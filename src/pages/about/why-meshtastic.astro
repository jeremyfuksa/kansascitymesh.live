      What I wish someone had told me about Meshtastic
    </h2>
    <p class="text-xl text-ink-700 dark:text-cream-100">
      Six months ago I didn't know what LoRa was. Now I've got a solar-powered node on my roof that can text someone 15 miles away with zero cell service.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-ink-700 dark:text-cream-100">
      Here's the thing nobody tells you up front: mesh networking isn't replacing your phone. It's stupidly simple backup communication that costs $50 to try and might save your ass when the cell towers are down.
    </p>

  <!-- What Mesh Actually Means -->
  <section class="mt-12">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-ink-900 dark:text-cream-50">The mesh networking thing, explained simply</h2>
    <div class="mt-6 prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
      <p>
        Your phone depends on cell towers. Those towers need power, fiber connections, working infrastructure. When any of that breaks, your phone becomes a brick.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mesh networking is different.</strong> Every device relays messages for every other device. No towers, no central infrastructure. Just cheap radios talking to each other, passing messages along until they reach who you're trying to contact.
      </p>
      <p>
        One node fails? Messages route around it. Power goes out? Nodes run on batteries or solar. Cell towers overloaded during an emergency? Mesh doesn't care—it was never using them.

  <!-- What Meshtastic Actually Does -->
  <section class="mt-12">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-ink-900 dark:text-cream-50">What Meshtastic actually does</h2>
    <div class="mt-6 prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
      <p>
        I'm using Meshtastic because it's the simplest way to build a mesh network without needing expensive equipment or a ham license.
      </p>
      <p>
        It uses LoRa radio (915 MHz, unlicensed band). Range depends on terrain and elevation, but I'm getting 5+ miles from my roof with a cheap antenna. People with better setups are hitting 20-40 miles.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="mt-6 prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
      <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Text messages, GPS position sharing, basic sensor data. Range is shockingly good for the power level—I'm running 20mW and getting miles of coverage.</p>

      <p><strong>What it doesn't do:</strong> Voice calls (text only). Internet access (it's not WiFi). Instant delivery (messages take seconds to minutes). Guaranteed reach (depends on node density).</p>

      <p><strong>The cost thing:</strong> $30-50 gets you started. No license needed (915 MHz ISM band). No monthly fees. Open source, so no vendor lock-in.</p>

  <!-- Why You'd Actually Use This -->
  <section class="mt-12">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-ink-900 dark:text-cream-50">Why you might want to do this</h2>
    <div class="mt-6 prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
      <p>
        <strong>Honestly? Because it's fun.</strong> Building stuff is satisfying. Learning how radio actually works by deploying hardware beats reading about it. Seeing your messages hop across nodes you deployed yourself is cool. That's why I'm doing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>But yeah, the emergency thing is real.</strong> Severe weather knocks out power and cell towers. Your node runs on battery or solar and keeps working. You coordinate with neighbors, check on family, report conditions. Some people care deeply about this backup capability. If that's you, great.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Events, camping, off-grid communication.</strong> Big festival with overloaded cell towers. Hiking trip with no service. Private text messaging and position tracking without infrastructure. All valid use cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Practice before you need it.</strong> Whether your motivation is fun or emergency prep, building capability now means you already know how it works when you actually need it.

  <!-- Why I'm Building This Way -->

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-ink-900 dark:text-cream-50">Why I'm building this way</h2>
    <div class="mt-6 prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
      <p>
        Most people buy a Meshtastic node, turn it on, and hope to connect to someone. That's fine for experimenting. It doesn't build reliable infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I'm placing four routers strategically</strong> at cardinal points around KC. Router 1 is up on the east side. Router 2 (west side) closes the critical gap. Routers 3 and 4 (north/south) complete the backbone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then client nodes fill in density. The result: actual coverage people can depend on, not just scattered nodes hoping to reach each other.

        <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-ink-700 dark:text-cream-100">Nope. 915 MHz ISM band is unlicensed. Anyone can use it. No test, no registration.</p>

        <summary class="cursor-pointer text-base font-semibold text-ink-900 dark:text-cream-50">How much does it actually cost?</summary>
        <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-ink-700 dark:text-cream-100">$30-50 to start. My first router setup was ~$150 with solar. No monthly fees, no subscriptions. Buy once, done.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-ink-700 dark:text-cream-100">No. It's backup for when your phone doesn't work. Keep using your phone for everything normal.</p>

        <summary class="cursor-pointer text-base font-semibold text-ink-900 dark:text-cream-50">What's the range?</summary>
        <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-ink-700 dark:text-cream-100">Depends on elevation and obstacles. I'm getting 5+ miles from my roof with a cheap antenna. People with towers are hitting 20-40 miles.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-ink-700 dark:text-cream-100">Gets better with more nodes. Current KC: east side works well, west side limited (why I need Router 2). As people join, reliability improves.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-ink-700 dark:text-cream-100">Messages are encrypted with a channel key (like WiFi password). Public channel = everyone with that key. You can create private channels too.</p>
