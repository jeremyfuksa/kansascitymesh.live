## Field log — 29 November

Every dot on the live map represents gear that is sending or forwarding packets. Midtown and North KC are stable, but the southern suburbs and Johnson County still look empty when you zoom in. That is not a software bug; it’s a call for hardware.

### Recent observations

- Router-grade installs on the Missouri side easily cross the river valley when they have even 15–20 feet of elevation.
- Indoor Heltec and SenseCAP clients in apartment windows routinely reach four to six miles so long as they are pointed toward higher ground.
- MQTT backhaul logging remains on a single Liberty gateway. We need a redundant feed closer to downtown.

### How to add value fast

1. Place a client where you live or work, even if it begins indoors. Document RSSI and SNR so others know what to expect from that neighborhood.
2. Walk or drive with a handheld so we can continue shading the coverage map with real data.
3. Offer high-site access if you manage a building, tower, or farm infrastructure that sees above the treeline.

## Why this site exists

I am freezing the messy bits of experimentation into something repeatable. When we write down what hardware, settings, and placement worked, the next builder can skip weeks of guessing. When we make our wish list public, the right person eventually recognizes that they already control the perfect rooftop. Everything here should feel like a logbook—today’s reality, not a dreamy roadmap.

## What you can expect next

- Weekly coverage snapshots so we know whether new neighbors are putting a dent in the gaps.
- Short write-ups on antennas, power systems, and enclosures that actually survived our weather.
- Progress on the Leaflet coverage dashboard once the data pipeline stabilizes.

There is no committee. If you can contribute a node, a host site, or a set of measurements, jump in.
