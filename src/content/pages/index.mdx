# Mesh network experiments for Kansas City

Text messaging without cell towers. $35 radios running [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) on unlicensed spectrum ([915 MHz ISM band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band)). No monthly fees, no license, no infrastructure dependency. The standard pitch is emergency backup—when severe weather or infrastructure failure takes out cell service, the mesh keeps working. That's true. But I'm just doing this for fun.

This isn't a company or formal organization. It's [one person's experiment](/about/operator), documented publicly. There are already 40+ nodes scattered across KC—this site is an attempt to coordinate instead of everyone working isolated.

## Getting started

- [Get a $35 node](/get-started/join), pair it with your phone, deploy it indoors.
- Questions? [Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) for real-time help, or read [what Meshtastic is](/about/why-meshtastic) first.

## Coordination with kansascitymesh.org

If you run kansascitymesh.org (or any other KC mesh effort), jump into the
[KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) and say hi. Collaboration
beats parallel, quiet projects. Let's share notes in the open.
