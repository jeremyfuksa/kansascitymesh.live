## How the Kansas City mesh is built

The KC Meshtastic network today runs on everyday client nodes spread across the metro. To really strengthen the network, we need to architect a strategic backbone of high-elevation routers, but those installs stay theoretical until partners with serious elevation raise their hands.

### Mesh topology in plain language

[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) is a peer-to-peer, self-healing [mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking). There is no central server or single point of failure. Each node repeats messages from its neighbors until the packet reaches its destination. When a node goes offline, the network routes around it. When a new node comes online, it joins automatically.

### Backbone roadmap (seeking hosts)

The draft backbone calls for always-on sites that form the cardinal spine of the metro. Each deployment needs reliable power, quality antennas, weatherproof gear, and minimal RF noise. Coverage priorities on the [deployment page](/network/coverage) feed this roadmap while we recruit hosts.

Client nodes already dot the map across KC, but backbone sites increase coverage and reliability.

### Why elevation matters (but doesn't require perfection)

Kansas City has about 200 feet of elevation change across the metro—enough to create strategic high points without requiring extreme deployments. The Missouri River valley sits lower than surrounding areas, which creates both opportunities and challenges for coverage.

**What this means for you**: If you're on a hill, your node reaches farther. If you're in a valley, you might need to connect through someone on elevated ground. That's it. You don't need to understand glacial geology—you just need to look around and see if your house sits higher or lower than your neighbors.

For partners considering backbone router sites, I'm prioritizing locations that combine local elevation advantage, clear horizons, sustainable 24/7 access, and filling coverage gaps. Full topographic details are on the [coverage priorities page](/network/coverage).

### Device roles

Meshtastic refreshed its [role guidance](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/radio/device/#role) in late 2024. KC sticks closely to it:

- **Client:** The default for handheld and vehicle nodes. Sends, receives, and repeats traffic.
- **Client Base:** A boosted client for your best-placed home node. Prioritizes rebroadcasting favorited neighbors.
- **Router:** Reserved for elevated, 24/7 infrastructure. Always coordinate before promoting a node to router status.
- **Repeater:** Router with telemetry silenced. Only for special, high-noise cases.

**Routers are reserved for partners who can combine significant elevation with reliable power and weatherized installs.** The ROUTER_CLIENT role was deprecated in firmware 2.3.15 due to widespread misuse that degraded network performance. Router and repeater roles should only be used for truly strategic locations (towers, skyscrapers, mountaintops)—not mobile nodes, car nodes, or typical residential installations. Spend some time as a client first; think thrice before randomly assigning roles beyond Client.

### Routing and hop limits

Meshtastic uses [controlled flooding](https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/mesh-algo/) with hop limits. KC keeps the default hop limit of 3, which balances reach with airtime. Nodes favor the routers they communicate with most, so elevating your node and favoriting the right backbone sites matters more than chasing raw transmit power.

### How you can help

- **Stand up a backbone router:** If you manage a repeater tower, commercial rooftop, or other high-elevation site, see [coverage priorities](/network/coverage) and let's coordinate the deployment.
- **Run propagation tests from your location:** Share results in [Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU).
- **Deploy your own node:** [Get started here](/get-started/join).

The architecture evolves as new data arrives, but the principles stay the same: high-quality backbone sites, lots of everyday client nodes, and coordination so we grow in the smartest places first.
