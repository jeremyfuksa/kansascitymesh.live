## How the network is built

KC’s mesh is a hybrid of everyday client nodes and a slowly growing backbone of curated routers. The clients give us density; the routers keep distant neighborhoods stitched together. MQTT gateways record what actually happened so we can tune the plan.

### Mesh topology in plain language

Meshtastic uses controlled flooding. Each node rebroadcasts a packet a limited number of times, then stops. That’s why we care about hop limits and router placement—every rebroadcast is valuable airtime.

### Backbone roadmap

We’re hunting for four anchor types:

1. **North bluffs** overlooking the river.
2. **Downtown rooftops** tall enough to see north and south.
3. **Southern ridgelines** in Lee’s Summit/Raymore.
4. **Western high sites** in Johnson County.

Once those exist, we can strategically link college towns and highway corridors outside the metro.

### Why elevation matters

A router on an 800-foot hill with a clear horizon can hear dozens of clients that would otherwise stay isolated. We trade perfection for practicality—15 feet above the roofline is worth more than chasing a 200-foot tower you can’t maintain.

### Device roles

- **Client:** Default for handhelds, home nodes, and experiments.
- **Client Base:** Semi-permanent indoor installs that rebroadcast for a known neighborhood.
- **Router:** Reserved for vetted high sites with maintenance plans.
- **Repeater:** Special-case router with telemetry silenced; rarely needed.

### Routing and hop limits

Hop limit stays at three across the metro. That balances reach with airtime. Routers favor neighbors they see most consistently, so uptime and clean horizons matter more than raw transmit power.

### How you can help

- Deploy a client in whatever part of the metro you call home and share the results.
- Offer high-site access if you manage a building, tower, or farm infrastructure with elevation.
- Volunteer to babysit MQTT gateways or routers if you have the technical appetite.

Every documented install makes the next one easier.
