This page provides a snapshot of the Kansas City Meshtastic network's current
status. Automated metrics and dashboards are in development; until then, updates
arrive here and in the community chat.

## Backbone routers

- **Router 1 — Liberty / NE KC (operational):** Online and routing traffic with
  99% uptime since January 2025. AC powered (solar retrofit slated for spring).
  Raspberry Pi 4 + Waveshare LoRa hat handles MQTT backhaul.
- **Router 2 — West side (seeking host):** Not deployed. Needs a high spot in
  northern Johnson County to bridge the metro. Hosting this is priority #1.
- **Router 3 — North metro (planned):** Targeting southern Clay County bluffs to
  reinforce cross-river coverage.
- **Router 4 — South metro (planned):** Aiming for northern Cass County to push
  coverage toward Belton and Grandview.

## Upcoming work

- Build the public coverage map and daily node count dashboard.
- Expand MQTT logging so we can publish anonymized traffic stats.
- Lock down Router 2 host site and schedule the deployment (jump into the
  [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) if you have elevation west of
  I-29).

## Recent activity

- **Jan 2025:** Router 1 launched with MQTT gateway.
- **Feb 2025:** Site planning underway for Router 2; preliminary surveys of
  Johnson County rooftops started.
- **Next milestone:** Secure a west-side host and deploy Router 2 hardware.
