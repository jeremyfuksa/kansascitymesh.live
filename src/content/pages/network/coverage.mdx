This page will probably change often. Just a few days ago, I had a screenshot of the map in my phone app on here, and it was out-of-date in two days.

I see 1-2 new nodes popping up every day, so blank spots I identify now may fill in quickly. 

## Current coverage snapshot

Right now the mesh is primarily all clients, which is expected. Once a rooftop or tower host comes online, that node will be a prime candidate for a router.

Drive testing from North Kansas City down to Midtown shows consistent reception. Moving southeast or west, coverage falls off quickly.

## Router approach

The metro only needs routers where we can combine serious elevation with clean RF environments. If you have access to a repeater tower, commercial rooftop, or other tall structure, consider taking on one of those backbone deployments. Everyone else should keep their nodes in client or client base roles so the channel stays efficient.

## Priority logic: Gap-filling over pure topographic optimization

The priorities below focus on **coverage deserts**—areas with few or no nodes that need fill-in. This is different from pure topographic optimization. For example, the Blue Ridge/Union Hill area east of downtown is topographically ideal (highest urban terrain, proven by broadcast infrastructure), but it already has decent node density. The west side has almost nothing despite being the metro's second-largest population center. That's why west comes first.

<details>
<summary>Understanding KC's topographic zones</summary>

Kansas City's terrain divides into three distinct zones that shape network strategy:

- **Northern Metro (Clay/Platte Counties):** Gentler glaciated terrain with bluffs overlooking the Missouri River valley. Smithville, Gladstone, and Parkville sit on elevated ground above the river, but overall relief is modest compared to the south metro.

- **Central River Corridor:** The Missouri River valley floor (around 720 feet elevation at Kaw Point) sits 200+ feet below surrounding bluffs. This elevation differential creates both propagation corridors (along the valley) and challenges (crossing perpendicular). Downtown and midtown occupy elevated ground south of the river.

- **Southern Metro:** Rolling hills with the metro's highest accessible points. Johnson County geology shows 150-250 feet of local relief along north-flowing streams, with hilltops reaching 990+ feet elevation. Lee's Summit and Grandview contain strategic high points.

**For backbone planning:** Elevation differences of 100-200 feet significantly affect coverage radius. Sites that combine elevation with clear horizons toward multiple zones provide the highest strategic value.

</details>

## Priority zones (will change as more nodes go up)

### 1. West-side backbone (Johnson County)

We need coverage west of State Line. Badly. The metro's second-largest population center has almost no nodes.

If you live in Johnson County, just get a node up. Even a 15-20 ft mast on a second-story in southern JoCo could close the gap.

Ideal backbone sites: Kill Creek Park observation tower (would need county permission), water towers in Olathe/Overland Park, elevated commercial sites near I-35. If you've got access to any of these, [Discord is where we coordinate](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU).

<details>
<summary>Why southern JoCo works well for this</summary>

Southern Johnson County has the metro's highest accessible terrain—hilltops around southern Olathe and Overland Park reach 990+ feet elevation. Kill Creek Park includes an observation tower that could anchor western coverage if we can work with the county. The elevation advantage here extends range significantly compared to valley-floor deployments.

</details>

### 2. North KC reinforcement

Bridging the river and extending north into Gladstone, Smithville, and Parkville. If you're in the Northland, deploy a node. Higher floors work better. Even a portable node on a third-floor apartment balcony helps us figure out what's possible.

Best backbone opportunities: Parkville bluffs, elevated ground in Gladstone, water towers (with permission). Locations with views toward downtown are what we need. Talk to me in [Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU).

<details>
<summary>River valley topography</summary>

This is about crossing the Missouri River valley—the river sits 200+ feet below surrounding bluffs. Parkville bluffs, Gladstone elevated areas (including the Kansas City Museum at 3218 Gladstone Blvd, reportedly KC's highest urban point), and Smithville vicinity provide strategic vantage points overlooking the valley.

</details>

### 3. South metro coverage

Sparse coverage along I-49 toward Belton, Grandview, and Lee's Summit. The terrain down here has natural advantages—rolling hills give you range even with modest installations. Neighborhood masts, eaves, barn roofs all work.

Lee's Summit residential areas on high ground, Grandview locations with views north toward midtown, commercial sites in Belton/Raymore would make good backbone sites. [Coordinate in Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU).

<details>
<summary>Local topography notes</summary>

Belton, Grandview, and Lee's Summit sit on rolling limestone hills—some of the metro's highest accessible points. Lee's Summit hilltops and Grandview's elevated areas have 150-250 feet of local relief, which extends range compared to flatter areas.

</details>

### 4. East corridor fill-in

Independence, Blue Springs, and Grain Valley already have light coverage. Just needs more nodes for density and reliability. If you're out there, deploy. Rooftops on high points work best. Portable nodes on commuter routes help map the remaining gaps.

Blue Ridge/Union Hill area has ideal topography (which is why broadcast towers cluster there), but node density is decent already. Long-term, commercial rooftops or tower sharing in that area would anchor metro-wide backbone.

<details>
<summary>Blue Ridge/Union Hill elevation advantage</summary>

The Blue Ridge/Union Hill area (east/southeast of downtown) is the metro's highest urban terrain at 880-920 feet elevation. KCTV Tower sits on Union Hill, multiple towers at 2100 Stark Ave in Blue Ridge. A backbone router here would provide 360-degree metro coverage, but existing node density makes it less urgent than coverage deserts.

</details>

## How to evaluate placements

1. **Elevation:** Natural high ground beats adding metal towers unless you've got access to an antenna mast.
2. **Line-of-sight:** Can you see (or almost see) the Northland/Downtown cluster or a candidate rooftop host? If not, can you bridge to someone who can?
3. **Power and maintenance:** Indoor power should have battery backup. Outdoor setups should have weatherproof enclosures and charge protection.
4. **Community impact:** Will this help an established area or connect two existing pockets?

Do you have an idea for an experiment? Pitch it in the [KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU).

## DIY coverage mapping

I use USGS elevation data and drive tests to validate what's possible. You can do the same:

1. Deploy a node on your roof or balcony. Leave it running for a week.
2. Toss a mobile node in your car and capture GPS traces while driving around your neighborhood.
4. Drop your findings in the Discord and see what we figure out.

## GeoJSON target area

<details>
<summary>View target area coordinates (GeoJSON)</summary>

Here's a feasible target area for the KC mesh. It's a rough box around the metro area.

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "name": "KC Metro Mesh Target Area",
        "stroke": "#E31837",
        "stroke-width": 3,
        "fill": "#E31837",
        "fill-opacity": 0.2
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            [-95.148729, 39.561616],
            [-93.948472, 39.561616],
            [-93.948472, 38.649439],
            [-95.148729, 38.649439],
            [-95.148729, 39.561616]
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

Deployments inside that box strengthen the core metro mesh. Once we have solid coverage there, Who knows? I think it's not that far-fetched to link the mesh between Manhattan, KS and St. Louis. There are enough college towns in between that probably have meshes going already. The trick is to find the right high points to bridge the gaps.
