This page will probably change often. Just a few days ago, I had a screenshot of the map in my phone app on here, and it was out-of-date in two days.

I see 1-2 new nodes popping up every day, so blank spots I identify now may fill in quickly. 

## Current coverage snapshot

Right now the mesh is primarily all clients, which is expected. Once a rooftop or tower host comes online, that node will be a prime candidate for a router.

Drive testing from North Kansas City down to Midtown shows consistent reception. Moving southeast or west, coverage falls off quickly.

## Router strategy

The metro only needs routers where we can combine serious elevation with clean RF environments. If you have access to a repeater tower, commercial rooftop, or other tall structure, consider taking on one of those backbone deployments. Everyone else should keep their nodes in client or client base roles so the channel stays efficient.

## Priority logic: Gap-filling over pure topographic optimization

The priorities below focus on **coverage deserts**—areas with few or no nodes that need fill-in. This is different from pure topographic optimization. For example, the Blue Ridge/Union Hill area east of downtown is topographically ideal (highest urban terrain, proven by broadcast infrastructure), but it already has decent node density. The west side has almost nothing despite being the metro's second-largest population center. That's why west comes first.

<details>
<summary>Understanding KC's topographic zones (optional background)</summary>

Kansas City's terrain divides into three distinct zones that shape network strategy:

- **Northern Metro (Clay/Platte Counties):** Gentler glaciated terrain with bluffs overlooking the Missouri River valley. Smithville, Gladstone, and Parkville sit on elevated ground above the river, but overall relief is modest compared to the south metro.

- **Central River Corridor:** The Missouri River valley floor (around 720 feet elevation at Kaw Point) sits 200+ feet below surrounding bluffs. This elevation differential creates both propagation corridors (along the valley) and challenges (crossing perpendicular). Downtown and midtown occupy elevated ground south of the river.

- **Southern Metro:** Rolling hills with the metro's highest accessible points. Johnson County geology shows 150-250 feet of local relief along north-flowing streams, with hilltops reaching 990+ feet elevation. Lee's Summit and Grandview contain strategic high points.

**For backbone planning:** Elevation differences of 100-200 feet significantly affect coverage radius. Sites that combine elevation with clear horizons toward multiple zones provide the highest strategic value.

</details>

## Priority zones (will change as more nodes go up)

### 1. West-side backbone (Johnson County)

**Why this is priority #1:** We need coverage west of State Line. Badly. The metro's second-largest population center has almost no nodes.

**What you can do:** If you live in Johnson County, deploy a node. Window, roof, fence post—doesn't matter. Even a 15-20 ft mast on a second-story in southern JoCo could close the gap.

**Want to host a backbone router?** Kill Creek Park observation tower (with county permission), water towers in Olathe/Overland Park, or elevated commercial sites near I-35. [Jump to Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) and let's talk.

<details>
<summary>Topographic details for site selection (optional)</summary>

Southern Johnson County contains the metro's highest accessible terrain—hilltops around southern Olathe and Overland Park reach 990+ feet elevation. Kill Creek Park includes an observation tower that, with county cooperation, could anchor western coverage. The elevation advantage here provides significant range extension compared to valley-floor deployments.

</details>

### 2. North KC reinforcement

**Why this is priority #2:** We need to bridge the river and extend north into Gladstone, Smithville, and Parkville.

**What you can do:** If you're in the Northland, deploy a node. Higher floors work better. Even a portable node on a third-floor apartment balcony helps us map what's possible.

**Want to host a backbone router?** Locations with views toward downtown work best. Parkville bluffs, elevated ground in Gladstone, water towers (with permission). [Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) is the place to coordinate.

<details>
<summary>Topographic details for site selection (optional)</summary>

This is about crossing the Missouri River valley—the river sits 200+ feet below surrounding bluffs, which creates both challenges and opportunities. Parkville bluffs, Gladstone elevated areas (including the Kansas City Museum at 3218 Gladstone Blvd, reportedly KC's highest urban point), and Smithville vicinity provide strategic vantage points overlooking the river valley.

</details>

### 3. South metro coverage

**Why this is priority #3:** Sparse coverage along I-49 toward Belton, Grandview, and Lee's Summit.

**What you can do:** Deploy a node if you're in this area. Neighborhood masts, eaves, barn roofs—all help fill the gap. The terrain down here has natural advantages, so even modest installations perform well.

**Want to host a backbone router?** Lee's Summit residential areas on high ground, Grandview locations with views north toward midtown, commercial sites in Belton/Raymore corridor. [Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) to coordinate.

<details>
<summary>Topographic details for site selection (optional)</summary>

Belton, Grandview, and Lee's Summit sit on rolling limestone hills—some of the metro's highest accessible points. Lee's Summit hilltops and Grandview's elevated areas provide natural propagation advantage with 150-250 feet of local relief that extends range compared to flatter areas.

</details>

### 4. East corridor fill-in

**Why this is priority #4:** Already has light coverage, just needs more nodes for density and reliability.

**What you can do:** If you're in Independence, Blue Springs, or Grain Valley, deploy a node. Rooftops that sit on high points work best. Portable nodes on commuter routes help us map the remaining gaps.

**Future backbone opportunity:** Blue Ridge/Union Hill area has ideal topography (which is why you see broadcast towers there), but it already has decent node coverage. Commercial rooftops or tower sharing in this area would be excellent for long-term metro-wide backbone.

<details>
<summary>Topographic details for site selection (optional)</summary>

The Blue Ridge/Union Hill area (east/southeast of downtown) is topographically ideal—it's the metro's highest urban terrain at 880-920 feet elevation, which is why broadcast infrastructure clusters there (KCTV Tower on Union Hill, multiple towers at 2100 Stark Ave in Blue Ridge). A backbone router in this area would provide 360-degree metro coverage, but existing node density means it's less urgent than coverage deserts.

## How to evaluate placements

1. **Elevation:** Natural high ground beats adding metal towers unless you've got access to an antenna mast.
2. **Line-of-sight:** Can you see (or almost see) the Northland/Downtown cluster or a candidate rooftop host? If not, can you bridge to someone who can?
3. **Power and maintenance:** Indoor power should have battery backup. Outdoor setups should have weatherproof enclosures and charge protection.
4. **Community impact:** Will this help an established area or connect two existing pockets?

Do you have an idea for an experiment? Pitch it in the [KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU).

## DIY coverage mapping

I use USGS elevation data and drive tests to validate what's possible. You can do the same:

1. Deploy a node on your roof or balcony. Leave it running for a week.
2. Toss a mobile node in your car and capture GPS traces while driving around your neighborhood.
4. Drop your findings in the Discord and see if the plan adjusts.

## GeoJSON target area

<summary>View target area coordinates (GeoJSON)</summary>

Here's a feasible target area for the KC mesh. It's a rough box around the metro area.

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {

        "fill-opacity": 0.2
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [

            [-93.948472, 38.649439],
            [-95.148729, 38.649439],
            [-95.148729, 39.561616]
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

Deployments inside that box strengthen the core metro mesh. Once we have solid coverage there, Who knows? I think it's not that far-fetched to link the mesh between Manhattan, KS and St. Louis. There are enough college towns in between that probably have meshes going already. The trick is to find the right high points to bridge the gaps.
