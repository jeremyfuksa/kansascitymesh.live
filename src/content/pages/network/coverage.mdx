This page will probably change often. Just a few days ago, I had a screenshot of the map in my phone app on here, and it was out-of-date in two days.

I see 1-2 new nodes popping up every day, so blank spots I identify now may fill in quickly. 

## Current coverage snapshot

Right now the mesh is primarily all clients, which is expected. Once a rooftop or tower host comes online, that node will be a prime candidate for a router.

Drive testing from North Kansas City down to Midtown shows consistent reception. Moving southeast or west, coverage falls off quickly.

## Understanding KC's topographic zones

Kansas City's terrain divides into three distinct zones that shape network strategy:

- **Northern Metro (Clay/Platte Counties):** Gentler glaciated terrain with bluffs overlooking the Missouri River valley. Smithville, Gladstone, and Parkville sit on elevated ground above the river, but overall relief is modest compared to the south metro.

- **Central River Corridor:** The Missouri River valley floor (around 720 feet elevation at Kaw Point) sits 200+ feet below surrounding bluffs. This elevation differential creates both propagation corridors (along the valley) and challenges (crossing perpendicular). Downtown and midtown occupy elevated ground south of the river.

- **Southern Metro:** Rolling hills with the metro's highest accessible points. Johnson County geology shows 150-250 feet of local relief along north-flowing streams, with hilltops reaching 990+ feet elevation. Lee's Summit and Grandview contain strategic high points.

**For backbone planning:** Elevation differences of 100-200 feet significantly affect coverage radius. Sites that combine elevation with clear horizons toward multiple zones provide the highest strategic value.

### Router strategy

The metro only needs routers where we can combine serious elevation with clean RF environments. If you have access to a repeater tower, commercial rooftop, or other tall structure, consider taking on one of those backbone deployments. Everyone else should keep their nodes in client or client base roles so the channel stays efficient.

### Priority logic: Gap-filling over pure topographic optimization

The priorities below focus on **coverage deserts**—areas with few or no nodes that need fill-in. This is different from pure topographic optimization. For example, the Blue Ridge/Union Hill area east of downtown is topographically ideal (highest urban terrain, proven by broadcast infrastructure), but it already has decent node density. The west side has almost nothing despite being the metro's second-largest population center. That's why west comes first.

## Priority zones (will change as more nodes go up)

### 1. West-side backbone (Johnson County)

**Why this is priority #1:** Coverage desert. The metro's second-largest population center has almost no nodes despite high potential user density.

**Topographic guidance:** Southern Johnson County contains the metro's highest accessible terrain—hilltops around southern Olathe and Overland Park reach 990+ feet elevation. Kill Creek Park includes an observation tower that, with county cooperation, could anchor western coverage.

**What to look for:**
- Kill Creek Park observation tower (coordinate with Johnson County Parks)
- Water tower partnerships in Olathe/Overland Park
- Elevated commercial sites near I-35 corridor
- Even a 15-20 ft mast on a residential two-story in southern JoCo could close the gap temporarily

### 2. North KC reinforcement

**Why this is priority #2:** Bridge the Missouri River valley. This isn't just "filling the northland"—it's about crossing the river's 200+ foot elevation differential between valley floor and surrounding bluffs.

**Topographic guidance:** Parkville bluffs, Gladstone elevated areas (including the Kansas City Museum at 3218 Gladstone Blvd, reportedly KC's highest urban point), and Smithville vicinity provide strategic vantage points overlooking the river valley.

**What to look for:**
- Bluff-top locations in Parkville with views toward downtown
- Elevated ground in Gladstone (Kansas City Museum area, commercial rooftops)
- Water towers with permission
- Even a portable node on a third-floor apartment balcony helps validate range

### 3. South metro coverage

**Why this is priority #3:** Sparse coverage along I-49 corridor despite good topography.

**Topographic guidance:** Belton, Grandview, and Lee's Summit contain some of the metro's highest accessible points thanks to rolling limestone hills. Lee's Summit hilltops and Grandview's elevated areas provide natural propagation advantage.

**What to look for:**
- Lee's Summit elevated residential areas
- Grandview high points with views north toward midtown
- Installations on neighborhood masts, eaves, or barn roofs along I-49
- Commercial sites in Belton/Raymore corridor

### 4. East corridor fill-in

**Why this is priority #4:** Already has light coverage, needs density.

**Topographic note:** The Blue Ridge/Union Hill area (east/southeast of downtown) is topographically ideal—it's the metro's highest urban terrain at 880-920 feet elevation, which is why broadcast infrastructure clusters there (KCTV Tower on Union Hill, multiple towers at 2100 Stark Ave in Blue Ridge). A backbone router in this area would provide 360-degree metro coverage, but existing node density means it's less urgent than coverage deserts.

**What to look for:**
- Blue Ridge/Union Hill commercial rooftops or broadcast tower sharing arrangements (future backbone opportunity)
- Independence/Blue Springs rooftops that crest ridgelines
- Grain Valley elevated residential sites
- Portable nodes on commuter routes help map remaining gaps

## How to evaluate placements

1. **Elevation:** Natural high ground beats adding metal towers unless you've got access to an antenna mast.
2. **Line-of-sight:** Can you see (or almost see) the Northland/Downtown cluster or a candidate rooftop host? If not, can you bridge to someone who can?
3. **Power and maintenance:** Indoor power should have battery backup. Outdoor setups should have weatherproof enclosures and charge protection.
4. **Community impact:** Will this help an established area or connect two existing pockets?

## DIY coverage mapping

I use USGS elevation data and drive tests to validate what's possible. You can do the same:

1. Deploy a node on your roof or balcony. Leave it running for a week.
2. Toss a mobile node in your car and capture GPS traces while driving around your neighborhood.
4. Drop your findings in the Discord and see if the plan adjusts.

## GeoJSON target area

Here's a feasible target area for the KC mesh. It's a rough box around the metro area.

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "name": "KC Metro Mesh Target Area",
        "stroke": "#E31837",
        "stroke-width": 3,
        "fill": "#E31837",
        "fill-opacity": 0.2
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            [-95.148729, 39.561616],
            [-93.948472, 39.561616],
            [-93.948472, 38.649439],
            [-95.148729, 38.649439],
            [-95.148729, 39.561616]
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Deployments inside that box strengthen the core metro mesh. Once we have solid coverage there, Who knows? I think it's not that far-fetched to link the mesh between Manhattan, KS and St. Louis. There are enough college towns in between that probably have meshes going already. The trick is to find the right high points to bridge the gaps.
