## Current coverage snapshot

Clients cluster along a north–south spine through Midtown and Waldo, plus pockets in Independence and Lee’s Summit. Everything west of State Line is thin. The Liberty MQTT gateway keeps the data feed alive, but we need redundant uploads and more routers in strategic locations.

## Router approach

We only designate ROUTER on installs that meet these criteria:

1. Significant elevation (natural bluff, rooftop, or tower).
2. 24/7 power plus some form of backup.
3. Weatherproof antennas and enclosures.
4. Someone committed to maintaining it when storms or firmware updates happen.

Everyone else should stay Client or Client Base so the public channel doesn’t drown in redundant rebroadcasts.

## Priority logic

We favor **coverage deserts** over perfect topology. Filling a county-sized gap matters more than squeezing a few extra miles out of an already busy area. Elevation still matters, but we balance it with population density and the ability to bridge existing clusters.

## Priority zones

### 1. West side backbone (Johnson County)

Silence from Lenexa to Olathe is the biggest hole on the map. Even indoor Heltecs pointed east would help, but we are especially interested in water towers, library rooftops, or office parks near 69 Hwy and I-435.

<TopoContext title="Why southern JoCo?" icon="🏙️">
Rolling hills down there reach 980–1,000 feet, which rivals many Missouri-side rooftops. Put a router there and it can easily see downtown on clear days.
</TopoContext>

### 2. North KC reinforcement

We need more nodes that can see both sides of the Missouri River. Parkville bluffs, Clay County water towers, and Gladstone rooftops are prime candidates.

<TopoContext title="River crossing strategy" icon="🌉">
The river valley sits ~200 feet below surrounding neighborhoods. Routers must sit above the bluff line or have direct line-of-sight to an anchor on the opposite side.
</TopoContext>

### 3. South metro coverage

Belton, Raymore, and Harrisonville have almost no nodes, yet their ridgelines are perfect for long-haul clients. We are looking for HOA-friendly installs—attic antennas, barn roofs, church steeples.

### 4. East corridor fill-in

Independence and Blue Springs need density more than altitude. Plenty of clients exist, but they drop offline as people experiment. We need a few semi-permanent base stations pointed west toward downtown and east toward Grain Valley.

## How to evaluate placements

1. **Elevation:** Are you above nearby rooftops or treelines?
2. **Line-of-sight:** Can you draw a straight line to another cluster on the live map?
3. **Noise:** Avoid sites crowded with competing RF gear unless you have to.
4. **Sustainability:** Weatherproofed, fused, and logged so others know what it’s doing.

## DIY coverage mapping

1. Run a client or tracker in your car and log RSSI/SNR.
2. Mark dead spots and post the GPX or screenshots.
3. Repeat after moving your node or upgrading antennas to quantify the improvement.

## GeoJSON target area

Anything inside that box helps the core metro. Once we stabilize it, we can start linking Lawrence, Topeka, Manhattan, Columbia, and St. Louis.
