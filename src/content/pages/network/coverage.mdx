This page will probably change often. Just a few days ago, I had a screenshot of the map in my phone app on here, and it was out-of-date in two days.

I see 1-2 new nodes popping up every day, so blank spots I identify now may fill in quickly. 

## Current coverage snapshot

Right now the mesh is primarily all clients, which is expected. Once a rooftop or tower host comes online, that node will be a prime candidate for a router.

Drive testing from North Kansas City down to Midtown shows consistent reception. Moving southeast or west, coverage falls off quickly.

### Router strategy

The metro only needs routers where we can combine serious elevation with clean RF environments. If you have access to a repeater tower, commercial rooftop, or other tall structure, consider taking on one of those backbone deployments. Everyone else should keep their nodes in client or client base roles so the channel stays efficient.

## Priority zones (will change as more nodes go up)

### 1. West-side backbone (Johnson County)

A router near Shawnee Mission or Prairie Village with decent height bridges the current network gap west of the river.

- Aim for rooftops, office buildings, or any location with clear line-of-sight toward Midtown and The Plaza.
- Even a 15â€“20 ft mast on a residential two-story could close the gap temporarily.

### 2. North KC reinforcement

Nodes on higher ground in Gladstone, Claycomo, or Smithville would create redundancy and extend coverage with the existing Northland client cluster.

- Look for opportunities to place antennas on rooftops, water towers (with permission), or hilltops.
- Even a portable node on a third-floor apartment balcony helps validate range.

### 3. South metro coverage

Belton, Grandview, and the southern edge of Kansas City need nodes to extend the mesh down I-49.

- Installations on neighborhood masts, eaves, or barn roofs will fill in gaps.
- If you can secure space near Lee's Summit or Raymore, it's an easy win.

### 4. East corridor fill-in

Blue Springs, Independence, and Grain Valley already show light coverage. A few more nodes there would create reliable east-west connectivity.

- Focus on rooftops or structures that crest hills or ridgelines.
- Portable nodes on commuter routes help map the gap until permanent routers go in.

## How to evaluate placements

1. **Elevation:** Natural high ground beats adding metal towers unless you've got access to an antenna mast.
2. **Line-of-sight:** Can you see (or almost see) the Northland/Downtown cluster or a candidate rooftop host? If not, can you bridge to someone who can?
3. **Power and maintenance:** Indoor power should have battery backup. Outdoor setups should have weatherproof enclosures and charge protection.
4. **Community impact:** Will this help an established area or connect two existing pockets?

Do you have an idea for an experiment? Pitch it in the [KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU).

## DIY coverage mapping

I use USGS elevation data and drive tests to validate what's possible. You can do the same:

1. Deploy a node on your roof or balcony. Leave it running for a week.
2. Toss a mobile node in your car and capture GPS traces while driving around your neighborhood.
4. Drop your findings in the Discord and see if the plan adjusts.

## GeoJSON target area

Here's a feasible target area for the KC mesh. It's a rough box around the metro area.

Deployments inside that box strengthen the core metro mesh. Once we have solid coverage there, Who knows? I think it's not that far-fetched to link the mesh between Manhattan, KS and St. Louis. There are enough college towns in between that probably have meshes going already. The trick is to find the right high points to bridge the gaps.
