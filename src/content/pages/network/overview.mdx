## Current network reality

The map shows 135+ nodes with real packets flowing daily. Midtown, Waldo, and North Kansas City are the most reliable clusters. Independence and Lee’s Summit are on the upswing. Johnson County still needs love.

### Testing methodology

We log every drive at 35 mph with a Meshtastic handheld paired to Android for screenshots. We compare notes with MQTT captures, user-submitted RSSI logs, and topography models from USGS. Nothing here is speculation—it all comes from packets we saw.

## How coverage works in KC

The metro is a game of relative elevation and clean horizons. If you can see across the river valley or over your neighborhood canopy, your node suddenly starts pulling messages from miles away.

### Elevation matters

<Figure caption="Kansas City elevation profile" src="/images/kc-elevation.png" alt="Elevation profile" />

Fifteen to twenty feet of elevation makes a noticeable difference. Roof peaks, backyard masts, or even third-floor balconies on hilltops stretch range dramatically. The tallest commercial sites—Union Hill, Blue Ridge, downtown high-rises—act like RF lighthouses when we can convince someone to host gear there.

### Indoor deployments

Indoor nodes are not wasted effort. Wood-frame homes with decent windows let plenty of RF out. Treat indoor installs as scouting missions: prove the site matters, then weatherproof and elevate later.

### Prosumer gear

You do not need broadcast equipment. Heltecs, T-Beams, SenseCAP trackers, RAK WisBlocks, and the occasional DIY Pi gateway make up 95% of the network. Match the configuration from the quick start checklist and they all play nicely.

## Coverage patterns

### West side silence

Johnson County and the I-435 corridor barely register on the map. Population is huge, yet the mesh has only a handful of clients. Even a modest second-story install in Lenexa or Olathe would light up dozens of blocks.

### North/South corridors

North Kansas City through Downtown and into Waldo is livable. South toward Grandview, Raymore, and Lee’s Summit still has huge gaps but plenty of natural elevation to exploit. The Missouri River valley remains both a moat and a highway—you need line-of-sight to cross it reliably.

### East corridor density

Independence, Blue Springs, and Grain Valley are improving. We’re seeing more routers on rooftops tied into the coverage map, but density drops fast as you head toward the exurbs.

## Where high sites help

A handful of elevated anchors would change everything:

<TopoContext title="West-side anchors" icon="📡">
Water towers near 135th/69 Hwy, Kill Creek Park’s observation tower, and tall commercial rooftops in Overland Park.
</TopoContext>

<TopoContext title="River crossings" icon="🌁">
Bluffs in Parkville and Gladstone plus downtown high-rises. Anything that can see both sides of the Missouri River counts.
</TopoContext>

<TopoContext title="South metro ridgelines" icon="⛰️">
Lee’s Summit, Raymore, and Belton neighborhoods perched on natural ridges. Many already have attic access perfect for discreet antennas.
</TopoContext>

When you find a spot that checks these boxes, hit Discord with details. We’ll help design power, antenna, and weatherproofing so you can promote it to a backbone router.
