This is the central source of truth for the Kansas City Meshtastic network. Here
you can find information about current coverage, infrastructure design, and the
plan for future growth.

## Explore the network

- **Coverage map:** Coming soon. This will visualize real-world reach and help
  identify high-impact deployment zones.
- **Network status:** A live dashboard is on the roadmap so you can quickly see
  router health and backbone uptime.
- **Network architecture:** Read the [architecture deep dive](/network/architecture)
  for the strategic plan behind the four-router backbone.

## The four-router backbone vision

The KC mesh backbone is designed around four strategically placed routers:

1. **Router 1 — Liberty (operational):** Northeast anchor with MQTT gateway.
2. **Router 2 — Western bridge (seeking host):** Needs elevation on the Kansas
   side to connect Johnson County.
3. **Router 3 — Northern river crossing (needed):** Southern Clay County bluffs
   to link the Northland back to the core.
4. **Router 4 — Southern sentinel (needed):** Northern Cass County to extend
   coverage south.

Hosting one of these routers is the fastest way to expand metro-wide coverage.

## Metrics roadmap

We're preparing automated dashboards that track:

- Total active nodes and daily check-ins.
- Estimated coverage area by elevation and antenna gain.
- Message volume and MQTT activity.

Until those dashboards launch, status updates will appear in the [network
status](/network/status) section and the community chat.
