## Current state of the KC mesh

There are 40+ nodes scattered across the Kansas City metro. Most are client nodesâ€”people experimenting. One router provides backbone connectivity from northeast KC.

Reliable metro-wide coverage needs strategic router placements at elevated sites. That's where you come in.

Jump to the coverage page for regional priorities or the architecture guide for the technical roadmap.
