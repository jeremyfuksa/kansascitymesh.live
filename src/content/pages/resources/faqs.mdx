faqs:
  - question: Do I need a license to use Meshtastic?
    answer: |
      No. Meshtastic uses the 915 MHz ISM band in the United States, which is
      unlicensed and open to anyone.
  - question: How much does it cost to get started?
    answer: |
      Budget $30–$50 for a basic node. A permanent, solar-powered outdoor router
      might run $150–$200. There are no recurring fees.
  - question: Is this a replacement for my cell phone?
    answer: |
      Nope. Think of Meshtastic as a backup text and location network. No voice
      calls, no browsing—just resilient messaging when infrastructure fails.
  - question: What's the range?
    answer: |
      Elevation and terrain matter. My roof (about 15 feet of elevation) reaches
      5–8 miles with a decent antenna. With tower height and clean line of sight,
      20–40 miles is possible.
  - question: Do I need a huge antenna or tower?
    answer: |
      No. Get the antenna outside with a clear view of the horizon. A modest pole
      in a backyard is often plenty to cover a neighborhood.
  - question: Can other people read my messages?
    answer: |
      Messages are encrypted. The default public channel uses a shared key so
      anyone on that channel can read them. Create private channels with your own
      keys for exclusive groups.
  - question: Is this an official organization?
    answer: |
      No. It's a hobbyist project documented in public so anyone can join in. The
      goal is to collaborate with anyone who wants to help build resilient
      infrastructure.
  - question: How can I help the network grow?
    answer: |
      Deploy a node. Indoor units add density; outdoor routers extend reach. If
      you have elevation, hosting a router is the biggest contribution you can
      make.
  - question: Does Kansas City's flat terrain hurt mesh networking?
    answer: |
      Kansas City isn't flat—we've got hills, river bluffs, and about 200 feet of
      elevation change across the metro. That's enough to create good high points
      without being so hilly that coverage gets blocked. KC's terrain is actually
      great for mesh networking. You don't need a mountain—you just need to be a
      bit higher than your immediate neighbors.
