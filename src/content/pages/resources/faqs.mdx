faqs:
  - question: Do I need a license to use Meshtastic?
    answer: |
      No. Meshtastic uses the 915 MHz ISM band in the United States, which is
      unlicensed and open to anyone.
  - question: How much does it cost to get started?
    answer: |
      Budget $30–$50 for a basic node. A permanent, solar-powered outdoor router
      might run $150–$200. There are no recurring fees.
  - question: Is this a replacement for my cell phone?
    answer: |
      Nope. Think of Meshtastic as a backup text and location network. No voice
      calls, no browsing—just resilient messaging when infrastructure fails.
  - question: What's the range?
    answer: |
      Elevation and terrain matter. My roof (about 15 feet of elevation) reaches
      5–8 miles with a decent antenna. With tower height and clean line of sight,
      20–40 miles is possible.
  - question: Do I need a huge antenna or tower?
    answer: |
      No. Get the antenna outside with a clear view of the horizon. A modest pole
      in a backyard is often plenty to cover a neighborhood.
  - question: Can other people read my messages?
    answer: |
      Messages are encrypted. The default public channel uses a shared key so
      anyone on that channel can read them. Create private channels with your own
      keys for exclusive groups.
  - question: Is this an official organization?
    answer: |
      No. It's a hobbyist project documented in public so anyone can join in. The
      goal is to collaborate with anyone who wants to help build resilient
      infrastructure.
  - question: How can I help the network grow?
    answer: |
      Deploy a node. Indoor units add density; outdoor routers extend reach. If
      you have elevation, hosting a router is the biggest contribution you can
      make.
  - question: Does Kansas City's flat terrain hurt mesh networking?
    answer: |
      Kansas City isn't actually flat—we have about 200 feet of elevation variation
      across the metro, with river bluffs, rolling hills in Johnson County, and
      elevated urban terrain around Union Hill and Blue Ridge. That's enough relief
      to create strategic high points without so much variation that coverage
      fragments into isolated pockets. KC's topography is nearly ideal for mesh
      networking—modest elevation advantages provide real coverage gains without
      requiring extreme deployments.
