Having trouble? It happens. Start here.

### Device won't power on

- Check the battery—charged, inserted correctly, and any hardware switch flipped
  on.
- Try another USB-C cable and wall adapter; some cables only carry power.
- Look for the small power toggle on boards like the T-Beam.

### Bluetooth pairing issues

- Toggle Bluetooth off/on, restart the node, and reopen the app.
- Default PIN is usually `123456`; otherwise check the device screen.
- "Forget" the device in system Bluetooth settings and reconnect through the app.

### App shows "0 nodes online"

- If you're first in the area, that's normal until another node is nearby.
- Confirm the region is set to **United States** in the app.
- Tighten the antenna; loose connectors kill RF performance.
- Compare your location with the [coverage notes](/network/coverage) to see if a
  backbone router is within reach.

### Poor range or coverage

- Move the antenna outside or into a window; walls and metal block signal.
- Elevation matters—getting above the roofline can double range.
- Upgrade to a 5–8 dBi outdoor omni when you're ready.

### Battery drains quickly

- Shorten the screen timeout or disable the display entirely.
- Lower transmit power if you're only covering short distances.
- Use a quality 18650 cell or external USB power bank for longer runtimes.
