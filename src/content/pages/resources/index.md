This is the central library for technical references, troubleshooting guides,
and quick answers for the Kansas City Meshtastic network.

## Status

I'm still drafting the reference material. Expect FAQs, frequency charts, and
troubleshooting notes once they're ready for publication. For now, everything
lives in my internal notes and deployment docs.
