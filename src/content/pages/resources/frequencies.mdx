In the United States, Meshtastic operates on the 915 MHz ISM (Industrial,
Scientific, and Medical) band. It's unlicensed, so anyone can use it without FCC
paperwork.

## Kansas City mesh channel settings

- **Region:** United States
- **Frequency band:** 915 MHz ISM
- **Preset:** LongFast (SF11, 125 kHz bandwidth)
- **Primary channel:** LongFast default (public)
- **Output power:** 21 dBm (legal max for the preset)

Choose the LongFast preset in the Meshtastic app to apply these automatically.
Add secondary channels for private groups, but keep the primary set to these
values so you continue relaying KC traffic.

you're responsible for operating within FCC rules and keeping your equipment in
good order.
