---

A mesh network is built by its people. Use this hub to connect with other
Meshtastic users in Kansas City, get help, and figure out how you can
contribute to the growth of the network.

## Start here

- **Discord server:** [Join the KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU)
  to coordinate installs, share signal reports, and chat with other builders in
  real time—including the folks chasing the west-of-I-29 gap.
- **Contact & coordination:** [Reach out through the contact page](/community/contact)
  when you want to compare coverage plans, co-host a router, or sync on events.
- **Success stories:** This section will showcase real-world deployments and
  creative setups as the network grows. Have something to share? [Let me
  know](/community/contact).

## How to contribute

This is a community project, and every contribution helps.

- **Deploy a node:** Every new node expands coverage and strengthens the
  network. Even an indoor node fills in local gaps. [Join the network](/get-started/join).
- **Host infrastructure:** Elevated real estate is gold. If you can host a
  router, you're directly expanding metro-wide coverage. [Learn about
  hosting](/guides/repeater-owners).
- **Spread the word:** Tell your neighbors, the ham club, emergency comms
  groups—anyone who benefits from resilient backup communications. Drop the
  Discord link when you do so they can plug in immediately.
