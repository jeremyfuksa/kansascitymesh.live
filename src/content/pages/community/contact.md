## Let's talk about building the KC mesh

This is a one-person project right now, but I'm actively looking for
collaborators, Router 2 hosts, and anyone who wants to help build mesh
infrastructure in Kansas City.

## Reasons to reach out

- **I have a west-side site for Router 2.** Top priority. If you have elevation
  west of State Line Road (Johnson County, western KC) and you're willing to
  host Router 2, let's talk immediately.
- **I operate kansascitymesh.net.** I know you exist. I don't want to compete—I
  want to collaborate. Let's coordinate efforts and build this together.
- **I want to help build infrastructure.** Repeater site owner? Technical
  skills? Time to volunteer? All of these help. Reach out and tell me what you
  can contribute.
- **I have questions about getting started.** Check the guides first, but if
you're still stuck or confused, I'll help. New users welcome.

## How to reach me

- **Discord:** [KC Meshtastic server](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) — fastest
  way to coordinate installs, share coverage reports, and find open projects.
- **Email (primary):** [`contact@kansascitymesh.live`](mailto:contact@kansascitymesh.live)
  — best for Router 2 hosting, coordination with kansascitymesh.net, and
  infrastructure discussions. I usually respond within 24 hours.
- **Meshtastic direct message:** Node `KC-Router1` (visible if you're in
  coverage). I check the mesh app a few times daily—great for quick tests and
  mesh-specific questions.
- **GitHub issues:** [github.com/jeremyfuksa/kansascitymesh.live](https://github.com/jeremyfuksa/kansascitymesh.live)
  for website bugs, content corrections, or technical suggestions.

> **Coordination fast-track:** kansascitymesh.net operator—DM me in Discord or
> email with the subject line "kansascitymesh.net coordination" so it jumps to
> the top of my inbox.

## Coordination with kansascitymesh.net

I know there's an existing kansascitymesh.net operator. I found the domain
registration while researching KC mesh activity.

I don't want to compete. I want to collaborate. Two people trying to build the
same infrastructure separately is wasteful. We should coordinate.

Current status: waiting to hear from the kansascitymesh.net operator. If that's
you, please reach out. Let's talk about combining efforts, coordinating router
placements, and building this together.

## What to expect when you contact me

- **I'm responsive but not instant.** This is a side project. I'll reply within
  a day or two for most things, faster for urgent Router 2 hosting inquiries.
- **I'm helpful but blunt.** I'll answer your questions honestly. If I think
you're overthinking something, I'll tell you. If the guides already answer your
question, I'll point you there.
- **I'm building this in public.** Conversations about network architecture,
  router placements, and coordination are fair game for documenting publicly
  (anonymized if requested).

## Want to dive in without emailing?

You don't need permission to join the mesh. Buy a device, configure it for the
KC mesh settings (915 MHz, LongFast), deploy it, and start contributing. Every
node you deploy makes the network better.
