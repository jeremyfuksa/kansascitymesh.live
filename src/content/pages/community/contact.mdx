## How to ask for help

Hop into the [KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) and head to `#kc-coordination`. Include your rough location, hardware model, antenna situation, and any screenshots. Someone will usually respond within a few hours because they are running similar gear nearby.

## When to DM vs. post

Default to public channels. Direct messages are fine for sharing gate codes or personal contact info, but everything else should live in the open so it becomes searchable for the next person.

## Already running infrastructure?

- Drop a quick note in `#coverage-notes` describing where the node lives, what role it’s running, and what its uptime looks like.
- If you need help babysitting the site, be explicit about what maintenance support you expect.
- Coordinate MQTT uploads before turning on sensors or telemetry so we keep the broker healthy.

## Keep the repo current
