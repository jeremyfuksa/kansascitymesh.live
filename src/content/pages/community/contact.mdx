## Build first, ask later

You don't need permission to light up a node. Buy the hardware, follow the
[getting started guide](/get-started/join), and put it on the air. The mesh grows
when more people deploy infrastructure, not when messages land in my inbox.

## Primary coordination channel

All real-time coordination lives in the
[KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU). That's where we swap
coverage reports, plan router installs, and work through troubleshooting. Join
the server, say hi in `#kc-coordination`, and share what you're building.

Email isn't part of the workflow and I don't monitor direct contact requests.
Discord keeps the conversation public so everyone benefits from the answers.
Thinking about an unusual experiment or permanent install? Float the plan in
Discord first so we can confirm it helps the network instead of creating extra
noise.

## Already running infrastructure?

- Document your deployment in the Discord so others know what routes through
  your node.
- Post signal reports, GPS traces, and range tests in `#coverage-notes`.
- Planning a permanent router? Compare your site with the
  [coverage priorities](/network/coverage) and let us know which gap you're
  filling.

## For kansascitymesh.org

If you operate [kansascitymesh.org](https://kansascitymesh.org) or any other KC
mesh effort, jump into the Discord and tag `@jeremyfuksa`. I'd rather combine
notes than create competing resources.

## Update the site or docs

Found an issue with this site or the documentation? Open an issue or pull
request on the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/jeremyfuksa/kansascitymesh.live). Keeping it in
GitHub makes the history transparent and easy to track.

Bottom line: deploy radios, share what you learn in Discord, and keep building.
