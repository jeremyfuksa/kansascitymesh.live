## Build first, ask later

You don't need permission to light up a node. Buy the hardware, follow the
[getting started guide](/get-started/join), and put it on the air. The mesh grows
when more people deploy infrastructure, not when messages land in my inbox.

## Primary coordination channel

All real-time coordination lives in the
[KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU). That's where we should swap
coverage reports, plan router installs, and work through troubleshooting. Join
the server, say hi in `#kc-coordination`, and share what you're building.

## Send a direct message to one of my nodes

All of my nodes start with `KF0NUI` in the name. If you can see one of them, you can
send a direct message over the mesh. It's a good way to test connectivity and
reach me without waiting for Discord replies.

## Already running infrastructure?

- Document your deployment in the Discord so others know what routes through
  your node.
- Post signal reports, GPS traces, and range tests in `#coverage-notes`.
- Planning a permanent router? Compare your site with the
  [coverage priorities](/network/coverage) and let us know which gap you're
  filling.

## Update the site or docs

Found an issue with this site or the documentation? Open an issue or pull
request on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jeremyfuksa/kansascitymesh.live). Keeping it in GitHub makes the history transparent and easy to track.

Bottom line: deploy radios, share what you learn in Discord, and keep building.
