## I'm Jeremy Fuksa

I'm a designer, developer, and infrastructure tinkerer. When I realized $35 radios could bounce messages around Kansas City without touching a cell tower, I was hooked.

The site you're on is my notebook in public. It's a mix of build logs, functional guides, and the strategy I'm following to make Meshtastic useful for the metro.

## Why document everything?

- I learn by writing things down.
- It removes excuses for people who want to help but don't know where to begin.

## What "one person" means

Right now, this website is just me. But I'm not trying to build this entire network alone. I'm using what I know to create options for the right people to get involved.

I documented what I learned and built this site because those are things I can do. The actual network grows when other people find this useful and decide to participate.

If you've got elevation and want to host 24/7 infrastructure, go for it. If you want to run your own mobile node and see what happens, the documentation is here. If you know someone with a ham repeater site or commercial building access, send them this way. The goal is a useful metro-wide mesh. I can't build that by myself, and I don't want to. What I can do is make it easier for the people who should be involved to actually get started.

## Not a club (yet).

It'd be cool if this turned into a club or organization with structure and regular meetups. I'm not the person to run that, but I'll do what it takes to support someone who wants to make it happen. Ideally, people jump on the
[KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) and start finding each other
instead of routing everything through me.

## Coordination with kansascitymesh.org

I noticed [kansascitymesh.org](https://kansascitymesh.org) exists but it seems like a dead site. If you're out there and active, hop into the Discord and tag `@jeremyfuksa` so we can combine efforts.
