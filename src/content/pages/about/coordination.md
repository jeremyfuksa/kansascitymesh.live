## This isn't a land grab. But we need clarity.

I've noticed kansascitymesh.net exists, but it appears to be an abandoned fork of
an Austin, TX mesh site, with templates still referencing Austin. That makes it
easy to assume the site is inactive and unmaintained, with no visible contact
information for its operator.

If you're the operator of kansascitymesh.net and you're still active, I want to
hear from you. I want to collaborate—not compete. If you're not active, or if
the site is indeed abandoned, then it's crucial for the Kansas City community to
have a clear, active resource.

I'm one person building mesh infrastructure independently. I deployed my first
router in Liberty on the northeast side of the metro, and I'm documenting
everything here so others can join. This site serves two purposes:

- **Resource hub:** Help anyone in KC who wants to deploy Meshtastic nodes.
- **Coordination signal:** Make it easy for existing operators (especially
  kansascitymesh.net) to find and contact me, or to clarify the status of that
  domain.

## What's the situation with kansascitymesh.net?

### Scenario 1: You're active, and I'm wrong!

If kansascitymesh.net is active and maintained, and I've simply missed your
contact info or community channels (Discord, Matrix, local meetings), then
**please reach out.** Point me to your active community, and I'll happily
redirect traffic there. I'd much rather support an established effort than build
in parallel.

### Scenario 2: You've been quiet, but want to restart

Life happens, projects pause. If you're the kansascitymesh.net operator and want
to revitalize your efforts, let's coordinate. We can discuss how to combine
resources, potentially pointing this domain to kansascitymesh.net, or working
together under a shared umbrella. Your choice.

### Scenario 3: The site is abandoned, and you're done

If kansascitymesh.net is truly an abandoned project, and you've moved on, I'm
here to continue building. I'll keep deploying infrastructure and documenting
everything for the KC community. If you ever wish to transfer the .net domain to
an active community effort, I'd be honored—but there's absolutely no pressure.

### Scenario 4: You registered it for "someday"

Perhaps you grabbed the domain with good intentions but haven't started building
yet. That's great! Let's build together. I've got one router running and three
more needed. You'd be joining something already in motion, and we can combine
our visions for a robust KC mesh.

## Why clarity and coordination matter

- **Mesh networks work better when people coordinate.** If there are multiple
  operators in KC working independently, we should know about each other. We can
  share coverage data, coordinate router placements, and avoid duplicating
  infrastructure.
- **A single, clear resource benefits everyone.** Right now, someone searching
  for "Kansas City Meshtastic" might find an inactive site with outdated
  information. One coordinated, active effort (whether that's mine, yours, or
  ours together) serves the community better by providing a reliable entry point
  and up-to-date resources.
- **I don't want to accidentally create confusion.** If kansascitymesh.net is
  truly abandoned, then this site aims to fill that void. If it's active, I want
  to support it. Either way, clarity helps the entire KC mesh community grow.

## How to reach me

I'm monitoring multiple channels. Use whichever you prefer:

- **Email (public):** `contact@kansascitymesh.live` — general inquiries and
  partnership discussions.
- **Signal / Matrix:** Details on the [contact page](/community/contact) —
  encrypted messaging for sensitive coordination.
- **On-mesh contact:** Node `KC-MESH-R1` — direct message if you're already on
  the mesh.

> **Response commitment:** I check these daily. If you reach out, you'll hear
> back within 24 hours—usually much faster.

## Status & timeline

- **January 2025:** Site launched, Router 1 operational. First infrastructure
  deployed in Liberty on the northeast side of KC.
- **February 2025:** Outreach campaign started. Contacting existing operators,
  publishing technical requirements, and mapping the metro coverage plan.
- **Next milestone:** Western coverage router. Actively seeking collaboration
  for Router 2 placement on the Kansas side of the metro.
