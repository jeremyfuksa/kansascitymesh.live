This project is an experiment in building a resilient, off-grid communication
network for the Kansas City metro area using Meshtastic. It's not a company or a
formal organization. It's a hobbyist-driven initiative, documented in public, so
that anyone can participate.

Our target coverage is Jackson County and the surrounding counties; anything
beyond that is welcome extra reach.

The primary goal is simple: create a reliable backup communication system that
works when other systems fail. The secondary goal is to have fun doing it and
learn about radio technology along the way.

## Our philosophy

We operate on a few core principles to keep the project accessible and
effective.

### The anti-dogma approach

The world of radio and mesh networking is full of myths that stop people from
getting started. We actively push back against them.

- **You don't need a 40-foot tower.** Fifteen feet in a backyard is often plenty.
- **Indoor nodes can work.** Test your building before giving up.
- **Perfect is the enemy of good.** A deployed, imperfect node is better than a
  perfect one that's still on a wishlist.

### A prosumer scope

We are strictly focused on what a "prosumer" or hobbyist can achieve. This
means:

- **Equipment in the $25â€“$200 range.** No expensive, enterprise-grade hardware.
- **DIY, weekend-achievable installations.** If you can't do it in a weekend,
  it's probably out of scope.
- **"Good enough" performance.** We're not a cell phone company. We're building
  something that works for the mission.

## Community and coordination

A mesh network is only as strong as its community. A key part of this project is
coordinating with anyone and everyone interested in building mesh infrastructure
in Kansas City. We are especially interested in collaborating with the operator
of the existing kansascitymesh.net to unify our efforts.

You can learn more about our approach to collaboration and why we believe a
unified community is so important. Start with the coordination notes and the
deep dive on why we chose Meshtastic for KC.
