## The real reasons people stick around

The emergency-prep elevator pitch is technically true: Meshtastic moves messages when the commercial grid falls apart. But the daily motivation looks different. Builders stay because it is strangely satisfying to watch packets hop across rooftops you helped light up. Neighborhood chats pop up without anyone flipping a switch. Coverage reports feel like a team sport.

People here fall into three overlapping buckets:

- **Tinkerers** who love radios, microcontrollers, and weatherproofing experiments.
- **Neighborhood connectors** who simply want to know their block can still pass notes when the cell system hiccups.
- **Infrastructure nerds** who enjoy orchestrating high sites, backhauls, and experimental automations.

All three perspectives keep the network balanced. We document everything so each new contribution builds on the previous one instead of restarting from scratch.

## Myths that slow new builders

import MythBuster from '../../../components/MythBuster.astro';

<MythBuster
  myth="You need commercial-grade towers."
  reality="Kansas City’s rolling terrain means even a modest second-story install can see miles of coverage if it has a clear horizon."
  details="<p>Put something on top of a garage or dormer before you start budgeting for masts. The metro’s total elevation swing is roughly 200 feet, so relative height beats absolute altitude.</p>"
/>

<MythBuster
  myth="Indoor nodes are useless."
  reality="Plenty of our drive logs come from radios that never left a window sill." 
  details="<p>Wood construction plus a halfway decent 915 MHz whip still reaches four to six miles. Use the indoor phase to validate placement, then harden it outside when you’re ready.</p>"
/>

<MythBuster
  myth="Routers are the default."
  reality="Client mode is the default. Routers are reserved for curated high sites with 24/7 power and maintenance plans." 
/>

<MythBuster
  myth="MQTT magically extends coverage."
  reality="If RF never hears the packet, MQTT never forwards it. Treat the broker like a logbook, not a backdoor chat." 
/>

## What you’re signing up for

- **DIY deployments.** Nobody is handing out gear. You purchase the hardware, flash it, and keep it online.
- **Public progress.** Share range tests, RSSI values, and antenna experiments in Discord so we can all learn.
- **Iterative upgrades.** Start with the easy win—an indoor Heltec, a SenseCAP tracker, a LilyGO handheld. Move outside or up a tower when it makes sense.
- **Community accountability.** When your router goes dark, someone will ping you because it matters.

## How this fits with KC

Kansas City is ideal mesh territory. The Missouri River carves a valley that routers must leap, but it also provides dramatic high spots. Downtown rooftops shoot north into the bluffs. South metro neighborhoods have 150–250 feet of relief built into everyday subdivisions. The west side is hungry for nodes and already has water towers begging for antennas. We do not have to imagine how a future network might operate; we have logs, screenshots, and routes showing how it behaves today. That’s why we bother documenting it so obsessively.
