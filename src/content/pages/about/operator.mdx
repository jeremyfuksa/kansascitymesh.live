## I’m Jeremy Fuksa

By day I design software. Nights and weekends I am the person obsessively logging what happens when we scatter Meshtastic nodes across Kansas City. I bought the first few radios because I was curious. I kept buying them because neighbors kept asking what to try next.

## The role I’m playing

- **Documentarian.** I flash firmware, move antennas, and write down what happened so that the next builder has fewer blind spots.
- **Connector.** If you have line-of-sight to a critical area, I want to know so the right people can help you harden that site.
- **Editor.** When new data lands—drive tests, MQTT captures, range screenshots—I fold it back into this site so it stays current.

I am not the president of anything. There is no formal club and no dues. I simply maintain the shared logbook.

## Why the notebook lives in public

Keeping everything in one visible place removes friction. Tower owners can vet us by reading the history. New builders can trace what worked in a neighborhood before ordering parts. People outside KC can adopt any idea without asking for permission. If you notice something missing or inaccurate, open an issue or PR and let’s fix it together.
