## I'm Jeremy Fuksa

I'm a UX designer, web developer, and tinkerer. The site you're on is my Meshtastic notebook. 

I'm not trying to build this entire network alone. I documented what I learned and built this site because that's in my wheelhouse. The actual network grows when other people find this useful and decide to participate.

If you know someone with a ham repeater site or commercial building access, send them this way. The hope is a useful metro-wide mesh, and we need people who already have metro-wide communications setups to make that happen.

## Not a club (yet).

It'd be cool if this turned into a club or organization with structure and regular meetups. I'm not the person to run that, but I'll do what it takes to support someone who wants to make it happen. Ideally, people jump on the [KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) and start finding each other instead of routing everything through me.

## Coordination with kansascitymesh.org

I noticed [kansascitymesh.org](https://kansascitymesh.org) exists but it seems like a dead site. If that's your site, let's talk about how we can work together.
