# Get on the KC mesh without overthinking it

I'm documenting exactly how I bring new nodes online so you can skip the trial
and error. Start with the path that feels right for your experience level. If
you're unsure, the join guide walks through everything in order.

KC traffic is still light, so give the mesh a few hours to notice a new node.
Share what you learn in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) so we
can map coverage faster.
