Welcome! This is the starting point for getting your own Meshtastic node online
and connected to the Kansas City network. The goal is to get you from zero to
operational as quickly and painlessly as possible.

There are a few ways to approach this, depending on your experience level and
what you want to do.

## Pick your path

- **I'm new to this.** Read the [full step-by-step guide](/get-started/join) to
  choose hardware, flash firmware, and configure your first node. No experience
  required.
- **I already know Meshtastic.** Jump to the [quick-start checklist](/get-started/quick-start)
  for the condensed KC-specific setup.
- **I just want to see the gear.** Browse the [hardware guide](/get-started/hardware)
  to compare devices, antennas, and solar setups.
- **I need the MQTT rundown.** Read the [MQTT checklist](/get-started/mqtt) so
  you can enable it without flooding the mesh.

## The four-step journey

No matter which path you choose, the process is generally the same. The full
guide walks through each step in detail:

1. **Choose hardware** that matches your budget and goals.
2. **Install the Meshtastic app** on your phone or computer.
3. **Configure your node** by flashing firmware and loading the KC channel.
4. **Connect and verify** by seeing other nodes and sending your first message.

## A note on cost

This is a hobbyist project, and we want to keep it accessible. You can get a
basic, functional node online for about **$30–$50**. A more permanent,
solar-powered outdoor router might cost **$150–$200**. There are no
subscriptions or monthly fees.
