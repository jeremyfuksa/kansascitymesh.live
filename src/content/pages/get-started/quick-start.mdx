## Quick start overview

You already know how to flash firmware and pair Bluetooth. Use this page as the checklist you keep open while retuning gear for Kansas City.

## Kansas City mesh config

- **Region:** United States 915 MHz
- **Preset:** LongFast (SF11, 125 kHz bandwidth)
- **Primary channel:** LongFast default (public)
- **Tx power:** 21 dBm
- **Hop limit:** 3 (leave it there)
- **Role:** Client unless you have explicit router approval

Keep the public channel even if you add private overlays so you continue forwarding traffic for everyone else.

## Deployment checklist

1. **Update firmware:** Use [flasher.meshtastic.org](https://flasher.meshtastic.org) and confirm the node reboots cleanly.
2. **Pair and rename:** Bluetooth pair, rename the device with neighborhood + elevation for quick recognition.
3. **Apply the KC profile:** Match the settings above and double-check that transmit power stuck at 21 dBm.
4. **Beacon and monitor:** Announce yourself with a short message, then leave the node online overnight.
5. **Log results:** Capture RSSI/SNR, map screenshots, and any anomalies. Drop them in Discord.

## Keep going

- Ready for MQTT? Follow the [MQTT checklist](/get-started/mqtt) so you don’t overload the broker.
- Want to host infrastructure? Read the [coverage priorities](/network/coverage) page and volunteer for a gap that fits your location.
- Traveling? Take a SenseCAP or T-Deck on the road and feed us more drive-test data.
