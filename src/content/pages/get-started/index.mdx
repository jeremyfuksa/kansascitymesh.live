## Get on the KC mesh without overthinking it

Every guide on this site reflects what we actually run in Kansas City. Pick the path that best matches your experience level:

- **Brand-new to Meshtastic?** Start with the join guide. It handles firmware flashing, app pairing, and the KC-specific radio profile.
- **Returning builder from another city?** Jump straight to the quick start checklist. It’s the shortest way to translate your existing gear to our frequencies and hop limits.
- **Need gear advice?** Hit the hardware page for radios and antennas that multiple locals have tested outdoors.
- **Curious about MQTT or automation?** Review the MQTT checklist so you know when to upload and when to stay RF-only.

Ship something small, share your findings, and then iterate. That is how this network keeps growing.
