## What hardware to buy

This isn't amateur radio. You don't need thousands of dollars of equipment.
Spend $25–$50 to get started. Budget $100–$200 for a permanent outdoor router.

## Radio devices

- **Heltec LoRa32 V3 (budget entry, $25–$30):** My first device. Great for
  trying Meshtastic on the cheap. No GPS, basic antenna, needs external battery
  for portable use, but works well indoors. Requires the Meshtastic phone app.
- **LILYGO T-Beam (mobile/GPS, $40–$50):** Built-in GPS, 18650 battery support,
  and reliable firmware. Perfect for vehicles and portable deployments. Still
  pairs with the phone app for messaging.
- **RAK WisBlock Meshtastic (infrastructure, $60–$80):** Modular, weather-ready
  hardware suited for permanent router sites. Runs standalone once configured
  and is ideal for backbone installations.

Where to buy: Amazon (fast, easy returns), the official Meshtastic store, or
AliExpress (cheaper, slower shipping). Double-check that you buy the **915 MHz
version**—the EU 868 MHz variant will not work on the KC mesh.

## Antennas

- **Stock / rubber duck:** Free to $10. About 2–3 dBi gain. Good for testing and
  indoor nodes.
- **Outdoor omnidirectional:** $15–$40. Roughly 5–8 dBi. Ideal for residential
  routers with some elevation.
- **High-gain collinear:** $30–$60. Eight to 12 dBi, but only worth it if you
  have tower-level height and a permanent site.

## Power and enclosures

- **Indoor nodes:** USB wall adapters or power banks are fine.
- **Outdoor routers:** 12 V power bricks or solar kits with charge controllers
  keep things running 24/7. Spend a little extra on waterproof enclosures and
  proper cable glands so you aren't chasing leaks.

## Accessories that help

- **Coax adapters and short SMA pigtails** to keep antennas outside while the
  radio stays indoors.
- **Mounting hardware** (J-mounts, tripods, chimney straps) for elevation.
- **Weatherproof boxes** (Bud Industries, ABB, or generic IP65 enclosures) to
  keep electronics dry.

Start simple, learn the gear, then upgrade strategically. Everything here scales
from hobby experimentation to infrastructure once you add better power, shelter,
and antennas.
