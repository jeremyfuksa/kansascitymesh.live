## Quick start for experienced Meshtastic users

Keep your base firmware current, match the config below, and you should see the
mesh within ten minutes.

Need a refresher or hardware advice? The
[join walkthrough](/get-started/join) covers every step, and
[hardware picks](/get-started/hardware) includes the gear most popular in KC.

## Kansas City mesh config

- **Region:** United States (915 MHz)
- **Preset:** LongFast (SF11, 125 kHz bandwidth)
- **Primary channel:** LongFast default (public)
- **Tx power:** 21 dBm
- **Hop limit:** 3 (default)

Match these and the node plays nicely with the rest of the metro. Layer your own
encrypted channels on top if you need privacy, but leave the public channel in
place so you still help route traffic.

## Five-step deployment checklist

1. **Flash the latest stable firmware:**
   [flasher.meshtastic.org](https://flasher.meshtastic.org) gets it done fast.
   Confirm the node reboots cleanly before unplugging it.
2. **Pair over Bluetooth:** You already know the dance. Default PIN is usually
   `123456` unless the screen shows something else.
3. **Apply KC radio parameters:** Region US-915, preset LongFast, output 21 dBm.
   Rename the device to something recognizable.
4. **Announce yourself:** Send a quick hello with rough location and whether the
   node is portable or fixed. That helps me update coverage notes.

## Keep going

- Want MQTT? Run through the
  [MQTT checklist](/get-started/mqtt) before enabling uplink.
- Deploying infrastructure? Post your node details in the
  [KC Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU) so everyone knows it's on
  the air. Planning something unusual? Ask in `#kc-coordination` first so we can
  sanity-check the impact.
- Testing antennas? Share range results in
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/eP5VSPKU).
