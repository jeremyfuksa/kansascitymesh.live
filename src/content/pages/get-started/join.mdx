## Start here

This walkthrough mirrors exactly how we bring new hardware onto the Kansas City mesh. Work through it once, note what tripped you up, and tell us so the next builder has one less surprise.

### Step 1: Pick hardware that fits your plan

Need alternatives? The [hardware page](/get-started/hardware) lists every radio, antenna, and enclosure people here have stress-tested. Whatever you buy, confirm it is the **915 MHz** variant.

### Step 2: Flash firmware first

Everything starts at [flasher.meshtastic.org](https://flasher.meshtastic.org):

1. Plug in the board with a reliable USB-C cable—data cables only.
2. Open the flasher in Chrome, Edge, or another Chromium browser.
3. Select your board type and choose the latest **stable** build.
4. Click **Flash** and wait for the success indicator. Resist the urge to disconnect early.

If the computer fails to detect the device, install the [CP210x drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) and try again.

### Step 3: Install the Meshtastic app

- **Android:** Install from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksville.mesh). It usually finds the node via Bluetooth automatically.
- **iOS:** Grab the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meshtastic/id1586432531) release and pair manually.
- **Desktop:** Use the [Meshtastic Web Client](https://client.meshtastic.org/) over USB if you prefer a larger screen.

Keep Bluetooth pairing simple. The default PIN is often `123456`. Rename the device once it appears in the app so you can recognize it later.

### Step 4: Apply the KC configuration

These match what we run metro-wide:

- **Region:** United States 915 MHz
- **Channel preset:** LongFast (SF11, 125 kHz bandwidth)
- **Tx power:** 21 dBm
- **Role:** Client (promote to Client Base or Router only after coordination)
- **Device name:** Something memorable—include neighborhood, elevation, or your callsign if licensed.

Leave advanced settings alone until your node proves it can pass traffic reliably. Once it does, explore routing or telemetry options with the quick start checklist.

### Step 5: Verify you are on the mesh

1. Watch the Nearby Nodes list for a few minutes. Seeing nothing initially is normal; give the mesh time to notice you.
2. Send a quick beacon with your general location. Leave the device online overnight so other nodes can capture it.
3. Check the [live map](https://map.kansascitymesh.live) later that day to confirm your node plotted.
4. Share screenshots and RSSI readings in Discord so we can update the coverage log.

## Optional next moves

- Validate line-of-sight using the [Meshtastic site tool](https://site.meshtastic.org) so you know whether a simple relocation will help.
- Upgrade antennas once you know the baseline works. Even a 5–8 dBi omni can double your range.
- Offer your site as a candidate router if you have stable power, weatherproofing, and elevation. Coordinate in Discord before switching roles.
