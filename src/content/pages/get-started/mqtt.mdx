## Why we care about MQTT

MQTT mirrors whatever traffic your node already heard over RF. It gives us a server-side log for coverage maps, outage forensics, and future dashboards. It does not replace radio coverage.

## What MQTT does for KC

- **Historical context:** We can rewind a day to see which routers were awake when a packet flowed.
- **Drive the live map:** The Leaflet coverage view uses MQTT as its data source.
- **Automation hooks:** People tie the broker into Home Assistant, Grafana, and scratch-built alerting systems.

## What it doesn’t do

- It will not resurrect packets your node never heard in the first place.
- It is not a private channel—treat uploads as public information.
- It does not give you an internet-only chat. RF always happens first.
- It has limited capacity. Flooding telemetry just wastes airtime and broker storage.

## Checklist before enabling

1. **Stable power + internet** at the site.
2. **24/7 intent.** MQTT works best on routers or client bases left on indefinitely.
3. **Clear purpose.** You’re feeding the coverage map, not just moving cat pictures.
4. **Discord coordination.** Announce your plan in `#kc-coordination` so we don’t duplicate uplinks.

## Settings to avoid

- Leave debug logs off.
- Only enable uplink/downlink for the channels you truly need.
- Change the topic key from the global default.
- Disable continuous sensor spam unless someone explicitly requested it.

## Current broker status

A Raspberry Pi gateway in Liberty currently mirrors packets into the KC MQTT broker. We are recruiting a second feed downtown for redundancy. Until that happens, keep MQTT usage lean and let us know before adding heavy uploads so the log stays healthy.
