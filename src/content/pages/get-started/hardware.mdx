## Selection philosophy

Start cheap, learn your neighborhood, then invest in the sites that deserve it. Most of our builders begin indoors with a Heltec or SenseCAP and only graduate to weatherproof routers after they’ve proven the spot matters.

### Budget radios

- **Heltec LoRa32 V3 ($25–$35):** Bright OLED, easy to flash, and tiny enough for stealth installs. Needs a companion phone or laptop for messaging.
- **LILYGO T-Beam ($40–$55):** Includes GPS and an 18650 tray. Great for mobile clients and vehicle experiments.
- **SenseCAP T1000-E ($55):** Credit-card-sized tracker with GPS and Bluetooth. Ideal for hikes or mapping drives.

### Portable plus keyboard

- **LILYGO T-Deck ($65–$75):** Built-in keyboard, display, and battery. Perfect for testing coverage from rooftops or balconies without a phone.

### Infrastructure-ready nodes

- **RAK WisBlock Meshtastic kit ($70–$90):** Modular boards designed for rugged outdoor enclosures. Pair with a waterproof box and a beefy power system for semi-permanent routers.
- **DIY Pi gateway:** A Meshtastic radio connected to a Raspberry Pi (often via the Waveshare SX1262 HAT) gives you MQTT logging, automation hooks, and remote management.

### Antennas that actually help

- **Indoor whips (claimed 5–6 dBi):** Cheap replacements for the stock rubber duck. Point them toward open sky.
- **Outdoor omni (5–8 dBi):** Fiberglass units with N-female connectors plus low-loss coax dramatically improve router reach.
- **Directional panels (8+ dBi):** Use sparingly to cross the river valley or connect known high sites—coordination required so we don’t starve nearby nodes.

Once your hardware is online, keep detailed notes: location, elevation, antenna height, RSSI/SNR logs, and uptime quirks. Feed that back to the community so we know what equipment thrives in which parts of the metro.
