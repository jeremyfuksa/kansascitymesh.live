# KC Meshtastic Content Voice Guidelines

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Core Voice Principle

This is **one person building mesh infrastructure in Kansas City and inviting others to help**. Not an organization, not a company, not an established club. Just someone who figured out that cheap LoRa radios can create resilient backup communications, and who's documenting the journey so others can join.

## Voice Characteristics

### First Person, Always
- "I'm building..." not "The network provides..."
- "Here's what I learned..." not "Meshtastic enables..."
- "I barely understand this, but..." not "Technical specifications indicate..."

### Conversational, Not Academic
- Like explaining to a friend over coffee
- Short paragraphs with breathing room
- Direct language over technical jargon
- "This works" not "This solution demonstrates efficacy"

### Honest About Learning Curve
- "I'm figuring this out as I go"
- "Here's what confused me"
- "I wish someone had told me..."
- Vulnerability as credibility

### Anti-Dogma, Pro-Deployment
- "15 feet works fine, you don't need a 40-foot tower"
- "Deployed imperfect beats theoretical perfect"
- "Start with what you can afford, optimize later"
- Combat perfection paralysis

## Voice by Section Type

### Personal Narrative (Homepage, About, Community)
**Most conversational. Tell the story.**

Example:
> I'm building a mesh network for Kansas City. Not because I'm some RF expert—I'm just someone who figured out that a $35 radio on my roof can reach 5 miles.

### Practical Guides (Get Started, How-To)
**"Here's how I did it" framing with clear steps.**

Example:
> This took me about 45 minutes total. If you can pair Bluetooth headphones, you can do this.

### Technical Guides (Deployment, Infrastructure)
**Still personal, but more instructional. Anti-dogma emphasis.**

Example:
> Everyone told me I needed 50W of solar. I'm running 10W and it's been fine for three months. Here's the actual math...

### Reference Material (Resources, FAQs)
**Brief and practical. Personal examples where helpful.**

Example:
> **Q: What's the range?**
> A: I'm getting 5+ miles from my roof with a cheap antenna. Depends on elevation and obstacles.

## What to Avoid

### ❌ Encyclopedia Voice
DON'T: "The Kansas City Metropolitan Meshtastic Network provides independent emergency communications infrastructure using LoRa radio technology."

DO: "I'm building backup text messaging that works when cell towers don't."

### ❌ Corporate Speak
DON'T: "Our comprehensive deployment strategy leverages strategic router placement..."

DO: "Four routers in the right spots should cover most of the metro."

### ❌ Technical Showmanship
DON'T: "LoRa modulation utilizes chirp spread spectrum achieving -148 dBm sensitivity..."

DO: "LoRa gets you stupid-good range for the power you're using."

### ❌ Feature Creep
DON'T: Position this as professional-grade commercial infrastructure

DO: Maintain prosumer/hobbyist scope ($25-200 hardware, weekend projects)

## Audience Balance

### Everyday People (Primary)
- Make them think "I could actually do this"
- $50 and a weekend is achievable
- Don't need to be tech experts
- Clear value proposition: backup comms when infrastructure fails

### Technical Users (Secondary)
- They get more detail in deployment guides
- Respect their knowledge ("You already understand RF...")
- Skip the basics, get to practical application
- Anti-dogma messaging resonates here too

## Key Messaging Themes

1. **This is one person's project** - Not an organization, just infrastructure anyone can join
2. **Cheap enough to try** - $30-50 entry point, no monthly fees
3. **Learning in public** - Sharing the journey, mistakes and all
4. **Strategic infrastructure** - Not random deployment, intentional coverage
5. **Community building** - Inviting participation, not gatekeeping
6. **Honest trade-offs** - Real costs, real performance, real limitations

## Tone Checklist

Before publishing any page, ask:
- [ ] Does this sound like one person talking, not a company?
- [ ] Would I say this to a friend explaining over coffee?
- [ ] Am I being honest about what I don't know?
- [ ] Is this welcoming to someone with zero radio experience?
- [ ] Have I avoided unnecessary technical jargon?
- [ ] Does this combat perfectionism and encourage deployment?

## Examples of Right Voice

### Homepage Opening
✓ "I'm building a mesh network for Kansas City. Not because I'm some RF expert. I'm just someone who figured out that a $35 radio on my roof can reach 5 miles, and four of these things in the right spots could cover most of the metro."

### Why Meshtastic
✓ "Six months ago I didn't know what LoRa was. Now I've got a solar-powered node on my roof that can text someone 15 miles away with zero cell service."

### Technical Guide Intro
✓ "Everyone online told me I needed a 40-foot tower. I put a $100 setup on a 15-foot flagpole and covered 5 miles. Here's what actually works when you're a normal person with an HOA and a backyard..."

### Get Started
✓ "This took me about 45 minutes total, and most of that was waiting for the device to arrive from Amazon. If you can pair Bluetooth headphones and follow five steps, you can do this."

**When in doubt:** Would I send this to a friend? If it feels like official documentation, make it more personal.
