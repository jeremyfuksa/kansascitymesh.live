- Prosumer/hobbyist scope maintained ($25-200 hardware)
- Non-tech accessibility prioritized

**Completed Pages:**

#### Homepage & About

#### Get Started Flow
- ✅ `/get-started/join` - Primary conversion path, honest motivation section
- ✅ `/get-started/quick-start` - KC-specific config for experienced users
- ✅ `/get-started/hardware` - Hardware selection with anti-dogma framing

#### Deployment Guides
- ✅ `/guides/ham-operators` - Respectful technical voice for licensed ops
- ✅ `/guides/repeater-owners` - "You have elevation" framing
- ✅ `/guides/solar-residential` - Anti-dogma manifesto (10W works, 15ft adequate)
- ✅ `/guides/router-gateway` - Configuration decisions explained
- ⚠️  `/guides/west-side` - **NEEDS REFRAMING** (see Phase 2)

#### Network Pages

## Phase 2: Voice Refinement & Administrative Pages - IN PROGRESS

### Voice Refinement Complete ✅

**All guides reviewed and updated to invitation/documentation style:**

1. **`/guides/west-side`** ✅ - Reframed from "help me find Router 2 host" to "here's what west-side deployment would look like"
   - Changed from recruitment to documentation of what would work
   - "Deploy your own router" messaging instead of "help me host Router 2"

2. **`/guides/repeater-owners`** ✅ - Updated from "I'm asking for" to "What you'd provide/get"
   - Invitation tone: "You could deploy a router that bridges the entire metro"

3. **`/guides/ham-operators`** ✅ - Already in proper voice (educational, invitation style)

4. **`/guides/solar-residential`** ✅ - Already in proper voice (anti-dogma manifesto, "here's what works")

**Voice consistency achieved across all critical pages.**

## Content Voice Guidelines Reference

See `06-CONTENT-VOICE-GUIDELINES.md` for detailed voice/tone requirements.

**Key principles:**
1. First-person narrative ("I'm building...")
2. Honest about learning curve and motivation (fun > emergency prep)
3. Anti-dogma throughout (deployed imperfect > theoretical perfect)
4. Welcoming to everyday people (not just RF experts)
5. **Invitation, not recruitment** - document what you figured out, let others take it and run

## Next Steps for Content Phase 2

1. **Reframe west-side guide** (highest priority)
   - Remove "help me find host" language
   - Change to "here's what the logical next deployment would be"
   - Shift from "I provide" to "you'd need"

2. **Review all guides** for invitation vs recruitment voice
   - Ham operators guide - check
   - Repeater owners guide - check
   - Solar residential guide - check

3. **Complete administrative pages** (can be minimal for launch)
   - Network status/growth (placeholder acceptable)
   - Resources (reference material, lower priority)
   - Community stories (will populate as deployments happen)

4. **Write section indexes** (navigation helpers)

## For Next AI Session

**Context to provide:**
- This is one person's mesh networking hobby documentation
- Motivation: "It's just fun" > emergency communications
- Voice: Invitation/documentation, NOT recruitment
- Scope: Prosumer/hobbyist ($25-200 hardware)
- Anti-dogma: Combat perfectionism that prevents deployment

**Files to review before continuing:**
- `06-CONTENT-VOICE-GUIDELINES.md` - Voice requirements
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview and constraints
- This file (`08-CONTENT-STATUS.md`) - What's done, what needs fixing

**Priority task:**
Reframe `/guides/west-side.astro` from "help me deploy Router 2" to "here's what a west-side deployment would look like if you wanted to do it."
