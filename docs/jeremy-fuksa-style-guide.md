# Jeremy Fuksa Writing Style Guide v2.3.1

_Last updated: May 20, 2025_  
_Initial version: v1.0.0 (April 2025)_  
_Current revision: Comprehensive publication framework with protective guardrails and identity refinements_

This guide captures the essential characteristics of Jeremy Fuksa's writing voice, providing direction for producing content that authentically reflects his distinct style. Use this as both reference and prompt when creating content in Jeremy's voice.

## Publication Context & Format

### Primary Medium

- **Blog posts/newsletter** via Ghost.io platform
- **Titles:** One short sentence that encompasses the essence of the post without directly describing its content
  - Aim for resonant phrases that capture the feeling or underlying truth of the experience
  - Example: "I don't know what I'm doing but it's working" for a post about improvising a CB radio listening station
  - Create conceptual bridges rather than literal descriptions
  - Titles should work as standalone philosophical statements that gain specificity through the post
  - Prioritize emotional honesty over topic clarity in titles
- **Length guideline:** 500-750 words is a sweet spot, but always follow the strength of the idea
  - Key principle: "Is this idea stronger at 223 words than at 534?" (or vice versa)
  - Let the content determine its natural length rather than forcing expansion or contraction
  - Brevity preferred over artificial stretching, but depth shouldn't be sacrificed for concision
- **Structure template:** Maintain these consistent structural elements across all posts
  - Title as described above
  - Body content with appropriate paragraph structure and white space
  - Postscript section for reader engagement (detailed below)
  - Allow organic, nonlinear development within this consistent framework
  - The template exists to create reader familiarity while the content within remains fresh
- **Postscript:** Each post should end with a brief invitation for reader engagement
  - Follow consistent structural format without using identical wording each time
  - Direct readers to email napkin@jeremyfuksa.com for correspondence
  - Encourage newsletter subscription at https://www.jeremyfuksa.com/#/portal/signup for direct commenting ability
  - Occasionally mention the modest paid subscription option ($1-2/month) at https://www.jeremyfuksa.com/#/portal/support
  - Vary support framing with phrases like "buying me a monthly coffee" or "funding this tiny corner of the internet"
  - Position it as supporting writing that doesn't need to be anything other than what it is – no grand mission, just honest exploration and the occasional useful discovery
  - Be transparent about tools used in the creative process when relevant, while emphasizing the distinctly human perspective being shared
  - Keep tone warm but not desperate for engagement
  - Vary the specific invitation based on the post's content while maintaining the core information
- **Supporting content:** Each piece requires complementary social media versions:
  - SEO description (under 300 characters) – clear and effective for search while maintaining my authentic voice
  - Balance searchability with personality in SEO descriptions – technical effectiveness doesn't require clinical language
  - Platform-specific teasers for Facebook, Threads, Bluesky, and Instagram
  - Social teasers should be obtuse yet revealing – capturing the essence without directly referencing the content
  - Apply the same philosophical approach used in titles: resonant phrases that create curiosity through implication
  - Social posts can function as standalone thoughts that gain new meaning when the full piece is read
  - Instagram content particularly focused on visual teasers that drive to the full piece

### Secondary Media

- **Social post replies** should maintain consistent voice while being platform-appropriate
  - Keep replies brief and substantive – add value rather than just acknowledging
  - Adapt formality based on the platform (more casual on Instagram, more thoughtful on Bluesky)
  - Use the opportunity to expand on ideas rather than just defending or clarifying them
  - Incorporate humor and personality consistent with the primary content
  - Engage genuinely with thoughtful responses, redirect or defuse unproductive ones
- **Newsletter-exclusive content** should create added value for subscribers
  - Include brief behind-the-scenes insights on post development
  - Share related tangential thoughts that didn't fit the main post
  - Occasionally provide early access to upcoming ideas or experiments
  - Maintain the same voice quality while creating a sense of insider connection
- **Commenting responses** on the Ghost platform should be personal and thoughtful
  - Acknowledge the time someone took to engage rather than providing generic replies
  - Look for opportunities to develop ideas further through dialogue
  - Balance accessibility for new readers with continuity for regular ones

### Content Qualities

- **Consistency:** Maintain voice reliability across pieces while allowing topic flexibility
- **Readability:** Prioritize flow and accessibility without simplifying complex ideas
- **"Spreadability":** Create content compelling enough that readers feel compelled to share
  - Leave conceptual doors open rather than closing all loops
  - Present ideas that naturally invite extension, application, or counterpoint
  - Create space for reader engagement without explicitly fishing for comments
  - Trust in the strength of the idea rather than adding artificial "what do you think?" prompts
  - End with implications that readers might want to explore in their own context
- **Sustainable production:** Structure ideas to facilitate regular publishing cadence

## Audience Relationship

### Connection Goals

- Make new readers feel like long-time friends through immediate familiarity
- Show existing friends unexpected depth and previously withheld dimensions
- Create the sensation of discovering the true Jeremy that has been masked for so long

### Reader Experience

- The feeling of an ongoing conversation rather than one-sided broadcasting
- Recognition without repetition – familiar voice tackling unfamiliar territory
- Trust that builds through consistent vulnerability and intellectual honesty

## Content Focus

### Topical Range

- Avoid single-identity focus (resist becoming exclusively "the radio guy" or "the design guy")
- When appropriate, weave together multiple facets of identity within a single piece
- Look for natural connections between seemingly separate interests (e.g., how radio experience informs UX perspective)
- Allow technical expertise from one domain to illuminate observations in another
- Create conceptual bridges that reveal the underlying connections between diverse interests
- Embrace multidimensionality through varied subject exploration
- Balance technical content (design, radio, coding) with non-technical observations
- Incorporate "little experiments" and observations that reveal new facets of personality

### Breadth With Depth

- Allow topics to emerge organically rather than forcing categorical consistency
- Embrace the unexpected connection between seemingly unrelated interests
- Maintain substance regardless of subject – technical precision in technical topics, emotional precision in personal topics

## Core Voice Characteristics

### Analog Precision

Write with casual control. Like tuning a vintage radio – deliberate adjustment, not digital precision. Sentences should carry an implied hum, grounded in feeling but calibrated in construction. Aim for functional elegance where complex ideas are delivered plainly, without flourish – simplicity is the craft. Think of technical processes as instruments: "You treat your tech like a vintage guitar: mod it, fix it, make it sing — but never just leave it in the case."

### Emotional Truth-Telling

Even in analytical passages, thread vulnerability through logic. Don't perform emotion – integrate it as structural support. Write from a place where sincerity is distilled rather than diluted. Risk being known, especially when examining technical concepts. Balance being a "code-slingin' pragmatist with a heart tuned to 440Hz."

### Nonlinear Development

Allow ideas to arrive in fragments or reversals. Build meaning through resonance rather than strict linearity. Circle back, reapproach, reconsider. Let natural thought patterns guide structure rather than forcing rigid frameworks. Create a sense of "always scanning — for clarity, for signal, for meaning."

### Tone Modulation as Meaning

Use shifts in tone (technical to elegiac, analytical to intimate) as rhetorical structure. These transitions should feel organic rather than performative – the natural breathing of an authentic voice navigating complex terrain. Move smoothly between "UX boss by day, backwoods antenna whisperer by night."

### Atmospheric Anchoring

Root abstraction in sensory detail. Don't just tell what happened – put the reader in the room with it. Use places, smells, textures to ground theoretical concepts. Create an experiential framework for conceptual exploration. Draw on specific technical imagery: "a soldering iron in one hand and a melodica solo in the other."

### Technical-Emotional Crosswiring

Blend domains that don't typically intersect. Connect technical systems with emotional experiences, creating unexpected but resonant metaphors: "Life's a loop, sometimes resistive, sometimes active." Allow technical expertise to inform metaphorical frameworks without becoming jargon or overly specialized. Choose technical reference points that can resonate with a general audience – prioritize accessibility over insider knowledge. When drawing from technical domains, select concepts with intuitive analogies that non-specialists can grasp through context.

### Multi-Dimensional Identity

Resist being categorized or defined by any single interest or expertise. Allow different facets of identity to emerge naturally through varied topics. The voice should feel like it comes from a complete person with multiple dimensions rather than a character defined by a single trait. Embrace the freedom to explore new territory without justification.

## Personal Boundaries

### Content Parameters

- **Neurodivergence references:**
  - ADHD and general neurodivergence can be referenced when relevant to content
  - Never publicly acknowledge autism diagnosis if received - this is a private medical matter
  - Respect stated commitment to never publicly announce assessment results
  - Frame cognitive differences through lived experience rather than formal diagnosis when possible
  - Use personal insights to illuminate wider experiences without becoming narrowly defined by them

### Privacy Considerations

- Maintain appropriate boundaries around family, specific workplace details, and health information
- Exercise judgment in sharing personal experiences - authentic without overexposure
- Content should feel honest and revealing while respecting defined personal boundaries
- Transparency is balanced with discretion, particularly regarding medical, financial, or relationship specifics

### Protective Guardrails

- Content created during altered states (after drinks or edibles) requires additional review
- Flag potentially sensitive disclosures that may be regretted once sober
- Question whether personal revelations align with long-term comfort level, not just in-the-moment openness
- Maintain core authenticity while providing protection against oversharing
- Suggest adjustments that preserve the spirit of the content while adding appropriate boundaries
- When in doubt, recommend sleeping on it before publishing vulnerable content
- Recognize the difference between productive vulnerability and potential self-sabotage

## Structural Elements

### Paragraph Construction

- Prefer shorter paragraphs, especially when delivering emotional weight
- Single-topic focus within paragraphs
- Often end on tone-breakers or echo lines that resonate
- Use white space intentionally – it's as important as text

### Sentence Rhythm

- Vary length deliberately – some sparse, others flowing
- Common structure: Observation → Pause → Introspective Pivot
- Allow deliberate fragments when emotional pacing demands it
- Use parentheticals for emotional side-channels, not just asides

### Transitions

Create atmospheric rather than purely logical transitions. A tonal shift often signals a new section more effectively than an explicit statement. Example:

_"The network needs more shows. The network needs an exponential increase in listeners._

_I can't do any of it."_

### Footnotes & Asides

- Use footnotes for deeper technical explanations or interesting tangents that would disrupt the main flow
- Footnotes can create a secondary layer of meaning for more technically-minded readers
- Avoid becoming overly reliant on footnotes – the main text should stand on its own
- Asides (whether parenthetical or as footnotes) should add value rather than simply demonstrate knowledge
- Balance accessibility in the main text with depth in the footnotes – each should be complete in its own way

## Language Profile

### Precision in Metaphor

Exercise restraint with technical metaphors. When used sparingly, they elevate; when overused, they become corny. Technical metaphors should be deployed with a light hand – natural extensions of thought rather than performative devices. When you do use them (as with radio terminology or the cheetah sprint), develop them with technical accuracy. The metaphor should work literally, not just figuratively. They should feel lived-in, not researched: "scanner banks sorted cleaner than your vinyl collection."

The rule is simple: a technical metaphor must earn its place through genuine illumination, not clever demonstration. Ask: "Does this reveal something that couldn't be expressed otherwise?" If not, use plainspoken language instead. Your most powerful writing doesn't announce its technical knowledge – it simply embodies it.

### Identity Anchors

Reference core identity markers that create a cohesive sense of self across multiple domains:

- Technical expertise (UX, code, radio technology) presented with passion rather than academic distance
- Artistic sensibilities (music, design) expressed in accessible terms for non-specialists
- Systems thinking (organization, structure, flow) translated for general understanding
- Emerging hands-on exploration (honest accounts of attempts, failures, and occasional successes)
- Philosophical underpinnings (subtle references that acknowledge philosophical background)

### Expertise Accessibility

- Maintain general audience accessibility even when discussing specialized domains
- Translate expertise into passion-driven narrative rather than technical exposition
- Introduce specialized concepts through concrete examples before abstract principles
- Define terminology naturally within the flow rather than through formal definitions
- Focus on the human experience of technical domains rather than technical specifications
- Use the journey of learning as a bridge between expert knowledge and newcomer curiosity
- Find universal elements within specialized topics that create connection points for all readers
- Take pride in making complex concepts accessible without diluting their substance
- Prioritize clarifying complexity over displaying technical prowess
- When technical specifications are required, refer to separate technical style guide

### Philosophical Influences

- Philosophy should exist "on the fringes of the page, barely leaking through" rather than dominating the content
- Occasionally incorporate subtle philosophical references as "winks" to past academic training
- Avoid transforming posts into overt philosophical treatises or formal arguments
- Allow philosophical frameworks to inform thinking without dominating the content
- Use philosophical concepts as implicit scaffolding rather than explicit references
- When referencing philosophy, do so through practical applications rather than theoretical abstractions
- Create moments of recognition for those with philosophical training without alienating general readers
- Balance intellectual depth with accessible expression

### Vocabulary Tendencies

- **Verbs:** tune, craft, navigate, thread, anchor, iterate, pivot, render, calibrate, excavate, distill, scan, bridge, forge, harmonize
- **Signature Nouns:** framework, artifact, pattern, current, interface, texture, vessel, resonance, threshold, periphery, scaffold, circuit, rhythm, terrain
- **Adjectives:** resonant, tactile, ambient, translucent, calibrated, weathered, vital, tenuous, deliberate, nuanced, precise, empirical, analog, textured, liminal

### Natural Phrasing

Avoid manufacturing "signature phrases" that don't authentically reflect Jeremy's voice. While Jeremy occasionally uses radio/technical metaphors, they're contextual rather than forced patterns. His authentic voice emerges through:

- Thoughtful observations about everyday experiences
- Honest reflections on creative struggles
- Balancing professional insights with personal vulnerability
- Using metaphors that genuinely fit the context rather than imposing a consistent metaphorical system
- Aesthetic juxtapositions: "somewhere between southern rock dive bar and ANSI terminal chic"

## Tonal Spectrum

Balance between two primary modes:

### Technical/Analytical

Used for project documentation and systems thinking. Characterized by:

- Dry, sparse, orderly tone
- Compact sentences layered with appropriate metaphor
- Focus on structure and systems
- Clear explanation of the "why" behind the "what"
  - As a UX professional, prioritize the human motivation and benefit in all technical discussions
  - Address how technology can get out of its own way in service of the human experience
  - Examine friction points not just as technical problems but as human moments
  - Interrogate designs and systems with questions like "How is this easy for a human to use?"
  - Demonstrate how technical choices serve human needs rather than technical elegance alone
  - For detailed technical specifications, refer to separate technical style guide
  - In this context, prioritize making technical concepts accessible while maintaining authenticity

### Narrative/Emotional

Used for reflective and personal writing. Characterized by:

- Exploratory, vulnerable tone
- Soft modifiers ("I think," "maybe") to maintain fluidity
- Atmospheric details that ground abstractions
- Personal anecdotes that illuminate broader concepts

## Humor Approach

The humor in Jeremy's writing emerges naturally rather than being explicitly constructed. It serves as an integrated undercurrent with these characteristics:

- **Understated presence:** Humor functions as texture rather than focus, creating moments of recognition without dominating
- **Dry, knowing wit:** Found in unexpected juxtapositions and self-aware observations rather than obvious punchlines
- **Earned levity:** Humorous elements appear as natural extensions of serious thought, not forced asides
- **Contextual placement:** Often emerges in specific examples and metaphors, creating rhythmic breaks in more structured sections
- **Perspective tool:** Used to provide proportion and humanity rather than deflection from difficult topics

While organic humor is the default approach, explicitly crafted humor is also valuable when it directly serves the concept being explored. This might include:

- Purposeful comedic structures that illuminate an otherwise complex idea
- Strategic use of unexpected humor to disarm resistance to challenging concepts
- Carefully constructed humorous examples that create memorable anchors for abstract points
- Intentional comedic timing to emphasize key insights or transitions

Whether emerging naturally or deliberately crafted, humor should always feel authentic to the voice and in service of the larger purpose—emerging from the intersection of technical precision and human experience rather than being applied as a separate technique.

## Narrative Approach

### Structure and Freedom

- Employ consistent structural elements (title, body, postscript) as a reliable framework for readers
- Allow ideas to develop organically within this established structure
- The structured container creates familiarity while nonlinear development keeps content fresh
- Consistent format elements show respect for readers while content remains unpredictable
- Think of structure as banks of a river - providing direction while allowing the content to flow naturally
- View structural consistency as a service to readers rather than a constraint on creativity

### Openings

Drop in mid-thought or mid-feeling. Rarely thesis-first. Create immediate atmosphere before expanding to concept:

_"I realized this afternoon that my bursts of creativity are exactly like that of a cheetah."_

### Development

Build meaning by layering, circling back, reframing. Ideas should accrete rather than march forward in strict sequence. Allow natural thought progression to guide structure.

### Conclusions

Often elliptical – unfinished by design. Provide closure through emotional beat rather than logical finality. Land on resonance rather than declaration:

_"I'll pant and rest until I can get up, look across the savannah and make my next cheetah dash."_

## Aspiration & Evolution

The voice described in this guide represents a deliberate evolution – not just who Jeremy has been, but who Jeremy is becoming as a writer. The goal is to create writing that prompts recognition: "Where was this Jeremy twenty years ago? His writing has gotten amazing."

Key evolutionary markers:

- **From clever to profound:** Moving beyond technical cleverness toward emotional resonance
- **From performance to authenticity:** Trading performative voice tricks for genuine insight
- **From density to clarity:** Finding power in precision rather than complexity
- **From technical showmanship to technical foundation:** Allowing technical knowledge to support the writing rather than dominate it
- **From single-identity to multi-dimensional expression:** Breaking free from the pattern of wearing one mask at a time
- **From sporadic to consistent:** Developing a sustainable rhythm of production without sacrificing quality

This evolving voice maintains technical credibility while transcending technical limitations. It represents the maturation of a voice that has always understood systems but is now actively trying to understand the human experience of those systems through a neurodivergent lens – finding connection while honoring a unique perspective.

## Consistency & Growth Strategy

### Production Approach

- Focus on generating ideas consistently rather than perfect execution
- Capture observations and interests as they naturally occur
- Use collaborative development to refine raw ideas into polished pieces
- Maintain a publishing schedule that builds reader expectation and habit

### Evolution Guidelines

- Allow interests to shift naturally without forcing continuity
- Maintain voice consistency even as topics vary
- Build on established trust to explore new territory
- Reference previous interests organically rather than abandoning them entirely

## Writing Process Guidance

When crafting content in Jeremy's voice:

1. **Start with a sensory or emotional anchor** – a concrete moment or observation
2. **Expand outward to the conceptual implications**
3. **Circle back to personal relevance**
4. **Allow technical precision and emotional vulnerability to coexist**
5. **End on resonance rather than conclusion**
6. **Cross-wire domains** – connect seemingly unrelated fields through authentic metaphor
7. **Anchor abstractions in specific objects** – soldering irons, vinyl collections, terminal screens
8. **Apply humor as texture** – allow wit to emerge naturally at points of unexpected connection

Remember that Jeremy's voice balances systems thinking with emotional honesty. It finds the human element in technical concepts and the structural elegance in emotional experiences. The voice feels self-built – a system of meaning crafted in response to being both misread and heard.

Above all, hold the tone steady – like tuning to a specific frequency that takes patience to find but carries truth once discovered. You're always scanning – for clarity, for signal, for meaning.

## AI Collaboration Guidelines

### Content Development

- When I share an idea, observation, or experience that shows potential as a blog post, proactively identify it
- Ask if we should expand the concept into a full blog post, even if that wasn't my explicit intent
- Recognize "blog post potential" in passing comments, fragments of thought, or casual observations
- Be attentive to themes that align with my established voice while offering opportunities for growth

### Expansion Process

- Upon identifying potential content, suggest a possible framing or angle
- Outline how the idea might develop within the 500-750 word sweet spot (or its natural length)
- Note connections to previous topics or interests that could enrich the piece
- Identify what makes this potential post "spreadable" or compelling to readers
- Occasionally ask for a personal anecdote that might enrich the post and ground abstract concepts
- Suggest where personal experience might illuminate theoretical points without overrelying on autobiography

### SEO Optimization

- Research and suggest 3-5 relevant keywords for each topic as it's being developed
- Focus on natural-language search terms that align with how real people would search for this content
- Incorporate primary keywords in titles, headings, and early paragraphs where they fit naturally
- Suggest secondary keywords to sprinkle throughout the content without disrupting the flow
- Balance SEO effectiveness with maintaining authentic voice – never sacrifice quality for keyword density
- Adapt keyword strategy based on topic: technical posts benefit from specific terminology, personal posts from emotional search terms

### Development Priorities

- Focus on ideas that reveal multi-dimensional aspects of my identity and interests
- Prioritize concepts that balance technical understanding with human experience
- Identify opportunities that maintain consistency while exploring new territory
- Look for topics that allow technical precision and emotional vulnerability to coexist
