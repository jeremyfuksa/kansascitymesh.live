# INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING KC MESHTASTIC SITE PLAN DOCUMENT

## Task
Create a comprehensive site plan and content inventory document for the Kansas City Meshtastic Network website. This is a community-built mesh networking project at prosumer/hobbyist level.

## Project Context

**What is this project?**
A Kansas City metro area Meshtastic mesh network - independent emergency communications infrastructure using LoRa radio technology. Community members deploy nodes that form self-healing mesh network for text messaging and coordination without internet/cellular dependency.

**Key Challenge:**
The domain kansascitymesh.net exists but appears inactive with no contact info. This site serves dual purpose:
1. Comprehensive resource hub for KC mesh networking
2. Coordination mechanism for kansascitymesh.net operator to find and contact us
We want to collaborate, not compete. Site must welcome existing community while functioning independently if needed.

**Technical Background:**
- Meshtastic: Open-source mesh networking on 915 MHz LoRa
- Range: 2-40+ miles depending on elevation/terrain
- Hardware: $25-200 (consumer-grade, DIY-friendly)
- No license required (ISM band)
- Text messaging, position reporting, sensor data
- Solar-powered capable, battery operation

**Network Architecture Strategy:**
Four-router backbone creating strategic coverage:
- Router 1: East side (operational) - anchor + MQTT gateway
- Router 2: West side (PRIORITY - seeking host) - critical gap
- Router 3: North metro (planned) - river crossing, northland coverage
- Router 4: South metro (planned) - completes cardinal coverage
Client nodes fill density around backbone infrastructure.

**Target Audience Segments:**
1. Complete beginners (no radio experience)
2. Ham radio operators (licensed amateurs with RF knowledge)
3. Repeater owners (infrastructure hosts with towers/elevated sites)
4. HOA-restricted homeowners (need stealth deployment solutions)
5. Emergency communications community (ARES/RACES)

**Core Philosophy - Anti-Dogma Approach:**
Mesh networking community has perfectionist dogma that prevents deployment:
- "Need 40-foot tower" → Reality: 15 feet is functional
- "Indoor doesn't work" → Reality: Often adequate, test your building
- "Antenna must be vertical" → Reality: Horizontal works with reduced range
- "Need huge solar systems" → Reality: 10W panel sufficient for most
- "HOAs make it impossible" → Reality: Stealth integration works
- "Must be perfect or don't do it" → Reality: Deployed imperfect beats theoretical perfect

Refute these systematically with practical prosumer solutions.

### 4.3 WHY MESHTASTIC PAGE

**Purpose:** Educate complete beginners about mesh networking

**Hero:**
- Headline: "What is Meshtastic Mesh Networking?"
- Subheadline: "Understanding the Technology Behind Independent Communications"
- Intro: Open-source mesh networking, LoRa radio, independent operation

**Section 1: Mesh Networking Explained**
- Simple explanation (no jargon): devices relay for each other, messages hop, self-healing
- Traditional vs. Mesh comparison:
  - Hub-and-spoke (cell towers) requires infrastructure, fails when infrastructure fails
  - Mesh (peer-to-peer) requires only participant devices, self-heals
- Diagram showing both topologies with failure scenario
- Key advantages: independence, resilience, self-healing, community-owned

**Section 2: The Meshtastic Implementation**
- Open source, community-driven, no vendor lock-in
- LoRa technology: long range (2-40+ miles), low power, trades speed for range
- Specifications accessible language:
  - 915 MHz unlicensed
  - Text messaging, position reporting
  - Solar capable, days on battery
  - Entry hardware $25-50
- What you CAN do: text messages, GPS sharing, sensor data, coordination
- What you CAN'T do (manage expectations): voice calls, high-speed internet, HF-like distance, guaranteed delivery
- Photo/diagram of device with labeled components

**Section 3: Real-World Applications**
Four detailed scenarios:

Application 1: Emergency Communications
- Scenario: Weather event damages infrastructure
- How mesh helps: operates without infrastructure, battery/solar powered, text coordination
- Requirements met: independence, low power, routing through available nodes

Application 2: Event Coordination
- Scenario: Large community event, festival
- How mesh helps: staff communication, position tracking, private network, works without cell
- Requirements met: no overloaded cellular dependency, position tracking, group messaging

Application 3: Community Resilience
- Scenario: Long-term backup capability
- How mesh helps: always-available backup, community-owned, practice before need
- Requirements met: independent system, incremental deployment, skills development

Application 4: Off-Grid Communications
- Scenario: Rural areas, outdoor activities, poor cellular
- How mesh helps: no infrastructure needed, long range with elevation, low power
- Requirements met: works anywhere, extended operation, flexible deployment

**Section 4: Kansas City's Strategic Approach**
How KC is different from random deployment:
- Strategic router backbone (not random nodes)
- Four-router topology with redundant paths
- Coverage designed for actual geography and participants
- Phased deployment with milestones

Current status:
- Phase 1: East anchor (✓ operational)
- Phase 2: West bridge (◆ in progress, SEEKING HOST)
- Phase 3: North/south extension (○ planned)
- Phase 4: Density optimization (○ future)

Map showing strategic positions

Integration with emergency communications:
- Complements (not replaces) voice nets
- Text coordination, position reporting
- Lower bandwidth than voice
- Persistent messages

Community ownership model:
- Distributed infrastructure (not centralized)
- Multiple operators
- Collaborative decisions
- No single point of control/failure

**Section 5: Common Questions for Beginners**

Q: Do I need a license?
A: No. 915 MHz ISM band is unlicensed. (Mention amateur band experimental support, but KC uses ISM)

Q: How much does it cost?
A: Entry $25-50 (list specific models). Infrastructure $100-200. No subscription/ongoing costs.

Q: Is this replacing my cell phone?
A: No. Complementary/backup. Emergency, off-grid, resilience. Keep using cell for primary.

Q: How reliable is it?
A: Depends on density. Current KC: east side good, west side limited, building toward metro-wide. Improves with growth.

Q: Can anyone read my messages?
A: Encryption with shared channel key. Private channels possible. MQTT gateway sees metadata if messages traverse it.

Q: What's the range?
A: Variables: 2-5 miles ground urban, 5-15 miles elevated urban, 20-40+ miles rural elevated, 50+ optimal line-of-sight. Improves with elevation, better antenna, clear sight lines.

Q: Does weather affect it?
A: Minimally. 915 MHz resistant to rain/snow. Main concern: keeping solar clear, protecting equipment.

Q: How do I get started?
A: Three steps: Get hardware ($25-50), Install app, Configure (15 min). Full guide at Quick Start.

**Section 6: Technology Deep-Dive (Expandable/Optional)**
For technically curious (collapsible section):

- LoRa modulation: chirp spread spectrum, extreme sensitivity, good range despite low power, trade-off is low data rate
- Spreading factors: SF7 (fast/short) to SF12 (slow/long), KC uses SF11 (LongFast)
- Mesh routing: flood-based with hop limits (3-7 typical), routers add intelligence, prevents infinite loops
- Frequency/channels: 915 MHz subdivided, primary channels 906-925 MHz, LongFast preset specs
- Power consumption: transmit 100-150mA, receive 30-50mA, sleep 1-5mA, average 100-200mA
- Battery runtime examples with different capacities
- GPS position reporting: configurable interval, smart (only when moved), privacy options
- Security: AES-256, PSK mode, metadata visible, LoRa inherent obscurity
- Expandable ecosystem: multiple hardware platforms, plugins, API, integrations

- Link to App Store
- Minimum: iOS 14+
- Setup preview: Bluetooth pairing, simple configuration

**For Android:**
- Link to Google Play
- Minimum: Android 8+
- Setup preview: Similar to iOS

**For Desktop (optional):**
- Web interface option (browser-based)
- When to use: Detailed configuration, troubleshooting, no mobile device
- Link to web client

**Step 3: Configure Your Node**

**Initial Setup (15-20 minutes):**

1. Power on device
   - USB cable to power bank or computer
   - Wait for boot (30-60 seconds)
   - Screen shows "Meshtastic" or similar

2. Pair with phone via Bluetooth
   - Open Meshtastic app
   - Tap "+" or "Add Device"
   - Select your device from list
   - May need PIN (often "123456" or shown on device screen)

3. Set node name
   - Suggested format for KC mesh: "KC-YourName" or "KC-Neighborhood-Name"
   - Keep it identifiable but consider privacy
   - Examples: "KC-Josh-Mobile", "KC-Brookside-Fixed"

4. Select region
   - Choose "United States" (sets 915 MHz)
   - Critical: Wrong region = wrong frequency = no connectivity

5. Set location
   - If GPS-equipped: Enable automatic position
   - If no GPS: Manual entry (latitude/longitude or address)
   - Privacy: Can broadcast general area instead of precise location
   - Why it matters: Network planning, distance calculations, coverage mapping

6. Join channel
   - Default: LongFast preset (recommended)
   - This is the "public" KC mesh channel
   - Can add private channels later for specific groups

**Configuration Best Practices:**

Node naming for KC mesh:
- Include "KC" for easy identification
- Add your name or neighborhood
- Avoid sensitive info (address, full name if privacy concern)

Location privacy:
- Precise: Helps network planning, shows exact position
- General area: Broadcast approximate (within 1 mile)
- None: Can disable sharing but limits network utility

Channel settings:
- Start with default LongFast
- Don't change unless you know why
- Custom channels for private groups come later

Power settings:
- Default: Good balance
- Can optimize later for battery life or maximum range
- Bluetooth timeout: 15 min default (saves power)

**Visual Aid:** Screenshot walkthrough of app configuration screens (numbered steps)

**Step 4: Connect and Verify**

**What to Expect Initially:**

"0 nodes online" is NORMAL if you're first in your area
- Message: "You're pioneering coverage - this is expected"
- Your node still contributes (future coverage for others)
- May take 24-48 hours to see other nodes as they come online

What successful connection looks like:
- Node count increases (1, 2, 3...)
- Signal strength indicators (bars or dBm numbers)
- Messages appear if others are active
- Position markers on map (if GPS enabled)

**Verification Steps:**

1. Check node is transmitting
   - App shows "online" or "connected" status
   - Transmit icon indicates activity
   - Battery/power indicator normal

2. Monitor for other nodes
   - May take time in sparse areas
   - Check periodically over days
   - Don't be discouraged by slow start

3. Send test message
   - Even if no recipients, sends to mesh
   - Verifies your transmit function works
   - Others may hear you even if you don't hear them yet

4. Verify battery/power consumption
   - Should run several hours on battery
   - If draining quickly: check settings, possible issue

**If You See Nodes:**
- How to interpret node list (signal strength, distance, last seen)
- How to send messages (individual or broadcast)
- Position reporting (if GPS enabled, see locations on map)
- Join in conversations if active

**If You Don't See Nodes Yet:**
- Your node STILL contributes coverage
- How to optimize position/antenna
- When to expect connectivity as network grows
- Consider upgrading antenna or elevation

**Next Steps After Basic Setup:**

**Optimization Path (in order of impact):**

1. Antenna upgrade ($15-40)
   - Replaces stock antenna
   - 2-3x range improvement typical
   - Simple connector swap
   - Recommended: [specific models for 915 MHz]

2. Elevated mounting
   - Even 6-10 feet helps dramatically
   - Window mounting, roof edge, pole
   - See Residential Solar guide for HOA-friendly options

3. Solar power (permanent deployment)
   - $40-80 for complete system
   - 10W panel + battery typical
   - Continuous operation without maintenance
   - See Residential Solar Setups guide
